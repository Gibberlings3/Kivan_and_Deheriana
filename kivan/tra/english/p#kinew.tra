@0    = ~You have changed, <CHARNAME>.~
@1    = ~I've been through a lot since we've part. No one could have escaped Irenicus' dungeons unscathed.~
@2    = ~I don't think so. Your compassion for me must be affecting your judgment.~
@3    = ~I might be scared, but I'm not an ounce weaker in spirit or body.~
@4    = ~Interesting. What is different about me?~
@5    = ~So the mirrors tell me. (wince) But... but inside, in my heart, I'm still the same <CHARNAME>. I still love my friends and try to do what's right under any circumstances, difficult as it may be at times... That's what is important, right? Not... not how I look.~
@6    = ~Next time, I will heed your professional advice.~
@7    = ~I think you will have no troubles recapturing your 'cute and playful' charm.~
@8    = ~Deheriana.~
@9    = ~(hand over his heart) I am half in love already!~
@10   = ~(tilt your head to one side) What will it take for you to go all the way?~
@11   = ~(wink) I learned from the master!~
@12   = ~Try a dramatic sigh with that.~
@13   = ~(Raise a brow.) Oh?~
@14   = ~(You laugh with a slightly exaggerated merriness; it's a more cruel joke than he knows.)~
@15   = ~And then what? Do you think that Sarevok would have spared Gorion?~
@16   = ~This land here would have been a battlefield if you had not run for your life and then did not go after Sarevok.~
@17   = ~My mother wished for more gentleness in me. When she went into Retreat, she told Deheriana to teach me better. I am afraid that she has been too successful.~
@18   = ~I am sorry for saying my thoughts out loud. A woodsman's habit.~
@19   = ~Being strong becomes a habit after a while.~
@20   = ~One woman, and I would have given every last drop of my blood for her to never know pain.~
@21   = ~Strength makes a woman more attractive, not less, at least that is how I feel... if my opinion on the subject makes a difference to you-~
@22   = ~Oh, yes, it does! (blush) Because... because you are an honest man.~
@23   = ~Don't worry, I won't bite your head off for telling me what you think about my figure... (But you brace yourself inwardly. Suddenly you realize that it is important... very important for you to know if Kivan finds you pleasant to look upon.)~
@24   = ~Go ahead.~
@25   = ~I'll die of curiosity if you don't tell me!~
@26   = ~Your opinion hardly matters, Kivan. I... I just think that I'm falling for someone, and I wish to know what *he* thinks of my appearance.~
@27   = ~Your opinion hardly matters, Kivan. I... I just think that I'm falling for someone, and I wish to know what *she* thinks of my appearance.~
@28   = ~Then you hide it well. Bravery is not in never experiencing fear, but in overcoming it.~
@29   = ~You are right. It is a pity that these qualities come at a high price. I would have rather been a soft-hearted coward than see Deheriana suffer.~
@30   = ~I just can't imagine you soft or craven, Kivan, no matter the circumstances.~
@31   = ~Yes, I would have bought out of the suffering and deaths I'd caused at the price of dishonor. In fact, it would have been better, perhaps, if Gorion gave me over to Sarevok on that very first night...~
@32   = ~(nod)~
@33   = ~I know. It had been the same way for me once, before I killed Tazok.~
@34   = ~Much of this 'for someone else' strength lingered though.~
@35   = ~I thought you would.~
@36   = ~(roll your eyes)~
@37   = ~The workings of a woman's mind are mysterious. My friend, if my opinion on the subject makes a difference to you-~
@38   = ~You might have lost the air of fresh innocence, but your eyes are deep now, there is a refined thinness in your face, and the way you set your lips - it is a taunt to any man. You look a challenge... and men love a good challenge.~
@39   = ~I'm forgetting that you like your women a-la martyrdom.~
@40   = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@41   = ~Then I will just have to adjust my seduction technique. If my leanness and dark looks do not go well with the 'cute and playful', well, I'll have to be 'mysterious and spirited with a hint of tragic past'.~
@42   = ~I am glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. Love and be loved.~
@43   = ~You have emerged from your ordeal a stronger, harder, more resolute <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@44   = ~I have no choice, but to be like this. For Imoen's sake.~
@45   = ~Yes, just like you.~
@46   = ~What nonsense! I'm almost soiling myself every time a rat stirs in the shadows!~
@47   = ~On the opposite, you have emerged from your ordeal a stronger, harder, more resolute <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@48   = ~Of course it does. But having known you for a time, having befriended you, I do know you well.~
@49   = ~But a rare <PRO_MANWOMAN> would have emerged stronger, harder, more resolute, like you did.~
@50   = ~How did the mage manage to capture you, mellonamin? You are as skillful as you ever were, and your companions were among the best mercenaries one could find in Baldur's Gate.~
@51   = ~You have seen what was left of the Promenade. The man is far more powerful than anyone I've encountered before.~
@52   = ~With my best scout traveling to Shilmista, it's unsurprising that we walked straight into an ambush.~
@53   = ~It was a perfect trap, Kivan. Some sort of sleep magic, illusions, shadows. I didn't know friend from foe...~
@54   = ~A dangerous toy, unfortunately, especially in Amn.~
@55   = ~Unfortunately, Amn is not the best place to practice magic.~
@56   = ~She had a good teacher. Not many outside Rashemen could boast of learning from a Rashemi witch.~
@57   = ~I think that it is forbidden, but Dynaheir was always unconventional.~
@58   = ~Yes, and I wish that I could have her now in my company, not dead...~
@59   = ~It was mostly self-study. Dynaheir was too busy with the bloody prophecies, but as she put it: "'twill be better if thou apply thyself, Imoen." So Imoen did, for once, and was arrested for it.~
@60   = ~He is a peculiar man, <CHARNAME>, with his own secrets, I suppose. I keep thinking that his face is familiar somehow, yet I am quite confident that I have never met him before.~
@61   = ~When she wanted you to, I assure you.~
@62   = ~We will save her, <CHARNAME>.~
@63   = ~Yes, this is understandable.~
@64   = ~Then it is for the best that it was not me, for this way you would get yourself killed. (softly) And I want you to live, <CHARNAME>.~
@65   = ~Be strong, my friend.~
@66   = ~I understand that, <CHARNAME>, but I would advise you to put saving the living above avenging the dead.~
@67   = ~I think you are playing with fire, <CHARNAME>. The fire expelled by an angry ancient red wyrm.~
@68   = ~Magic?~
@69   = ~Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you - she had apparently figured out how to cast a cantrip or two while still in Baldur's Gate, so Dynaheir caught her at that and put her to serious study.~
@70   = ~Yes, she was always smart, and learned quickly... Alas, casting a magic missile in the plain view of the Cowled Wizards was what got her arrested.~
@71   = ~Yes, Imoen the Magnificent is now Imoen, the Great Sorceress of the Sword Coast... or something like that. You know her. A new toy, and all.~
@72   = ~You underestimate her, <CHARNAME>. I saw her work, and she beyond all expectations could be stealthy.~
@73   = ~You'd know better, I suppose. It was just that I could always spot her...~
@74   = ~She used to be, but after she started dabbling in magic...~
@75   = ~Speaking of shadowy characters, what do you think of Yoshimo?~
@76   = ~Do you imply that you wish for me to be in her place? I wish that myself.~
@77   = ~Oh, Kivan, if that were you, I'd swim the Sea of Swords and storm right in wielding a broomstick if I had to!~
@78   = ~No, no. I'm just upset about the whole business.~
@79   = ~Yes, I could stand losing anybody but Imoen!~
@80   = ~You should not dismiss the possibility of this man having allies, or even, however unlikely, his being a servant to an unknown power. All this troubles me.~
@81   = ~It sounds that your current foe is more cunning and more subtle than Sarevok.~
@82   = ~But you have no choice but to go after him: Imoen is your trusted friend.~
@83   = ~Imoen is a brat! Irenicus... he made me an offer of power, Kivan, and I want him to unlock the potential within me.~
@84   = ~Yes, Imoen... There is another thing too: Irenicus... he made me an offer of power, Kivan, and I want him to unlock the potential within me.~
@85   = ~I'm sure that Imoen can find a way out on her own. What I truly want is to avenge Khalid and Dynaheir.~
@86   = ~Right you are! I can't sleep for worry of her. And I see weird dreams.~
@87   = ~Imoen is quite capable -~
@88   = ~And she paid for that!~
@89   = ~Please! She's my childhood friend and all, but her pink outfit would alert a blind mole underground about her approach!~
@90   = ~So, the mage Irenicus came after you himself?~
@91   = ~I don't think so. At least I don't remember seeing him. But there was strong magic in the air: sleep, illusions, shadows. I didn't know a friend from a foe...  ~
@92   = ~Who else?~
@93   = ~I still cannot come to terms with Khalid and Dynaheir's deaths. We had been through tight places before and managed to emerge victorious.~
@94   = ~They are dead, alright. It's no use talking about it.~
@95   = ~Alas, Kivan, they are dead. At least Khalid is. I've seen what was left of him in the dungeon.~
@96   = ~Maybe... maybe one day we could afford a miracle and bring them both back.~
@97   = ~As you wish, but I have a fool's hope that they are alive.~
@98   = ~Suit yourself.~
@99   = ~What do you mean - what was left of him?~
@100  = ~His body was mutilated.~
@101  = ~That I've seen his body, and he was dead.~
@102  = ~If they wish to live.~
@103  = ~I feel guilty since they've died because of me, because of what I am. I'd like to... make amends.~
@104  = ~If they wished to live... Khalid's body was mutilated almost beyond recognition, Kivan.~
@105  = ~Yes, of course. But for now let's focus on rescuing Imoen.~
@106  = ~I want them back! That's me who'd be paying for the spell, so why their wishes should matter?~
@107  = ~Mutilated?!~
@108  = ~Are you going to echo every word I say?~
@109  = ~Yes, Kivan, mutilated. Should I have been more descriptive? His skull was split open, his hands and feet were cut off, one of his eyes was put out, his genitalia -~
@110  = ~I have seen such things in Irenicus' dungeon... Khalid was among the lucky ones. There were jars full of still living... parts of people who offended the mage somehow. One just happened to enter the wrong room. There were clones of a woman driven mad by whatever Irenicus did to them. There were dryads held as concubines...~
@111  = ~What of Dynaheir?~
@112  = ~Minsc saw her die, but I don't want to trouble him with questioning.~
@113  = ~Minsc witnessed her death. It seemed to have upset his already damaged mind, as I couldn't get any details from him, just fury and agony.~
@114  = ~She is dead. Maybe... maybe one day we could afford a miracle and bring them both back.~
@115  = ~It is a noble sentiment, but do not forget that you should follow their wishes, not just pacify your conscience.~
@116  = ~It's easy for you to say!~
@117  = ~You're right, of course.~
@118  = ~Yes, I apologize for holding you back with my questions.~
@119  = ~Because it is their lives, <CHARNAME>.~
@120  = ~No.~
@121  = ~Enough! I pray that Dynaheir's fate was less cruel.~
@122  = ~Minsc witnessed her death. It seemed to have upset further his already damaged mind, as I couldn't get any details from him, just fury and agony.~
@123  = ~I have seen the things in Irenicus' dungeon... The dead were the lucky ones. There were jars full of still living... parts of people who offended the mage somehow. One just happened to enter the wrong room. There were clones of a woman driven mad by whatever it was that Irenicus did to them. There were dryads held as concubines...~
@124  = ~So do I. Maybe... maybe one day we could afford a miracle and bring them both back.~
@125  = ~And there were you, caged and tortured, then healed and tortured again. I hope we will get to the mage sooner or later and make him pay for the suffering he caused.~
@126  = ~There is no need to augment his pain, <CHARNAME>. Irenicus left enough suffering in his wake as it is.~
@127  = ~No, it was very difficult for me to say.~
@128  = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what occupied your time in Baldur's Gate, after my departure for Shilmista?~
@129  = ~Oh, nothing much, really.~
@130  = ~I was spending my time with the best mentors I could find to perfect my skills.~
@131  = ~There were countless balls and parties and celebrations in my honor. Why, I was about to suggest to the Dukes that installing my simulacrum in the Hall of Wonders would be a lovely idea so that everyone who wanted could express their thanks to <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@132  = ~I had so much fun! There were celebrations and festivities in my honor almost every night!~
@133  = ~I lived quietly on Duke Eltan's estate, trying to come to terms with the truth about my heritage, and to try to decide on what to do next.~
@134  = ~I adventured a little, helping local folks, much the same way we did before.~
@135  = ~Are you so sure?~
@136  = ~Truly, mellonamin, we have our reasons to be wary of the outsiders.~
@137  = ~I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@138  = ~By the sea and stars! That arrow would have to go through my chest first.~
@139  = ~I will be frank, mellonamin. My people are less wary of the N'Tel'Quess than they used to be, but I do not wish to mar our farewells with the cold reception that they might bestow on you.~
@140  = ~I don't care, Kivan. As long as your kin don't shoot me on sight.~
@141  = ~Then, I guess, it would be for the best if I don't come.~
@142  = ~Your kin is a bunch of snobs with one notable exception. You.~
@143  = ~(Pout.)~
@144  = ~Of course, mellonamin. It will be good for you to see the elven lands.  Perhaps you could bond to one of the nations and establish the connection that was never forged due to the circumstances of your birth.~
@145  = ~(sob) I know. Can I come with you? To say good-bye?~
@146  = ~So, this is your choice. I will miss you.~
@147  = ~Because every elf wishes to be among his own kin, in his own land when he is ready to depart for Arvanaith.~
@148  = ~(sob) Can I come with you? To say good-bye?~
@149  = ~You are returning to Shilmista to die...~
@150  = ~(nod) Do you know the fate of our other companions?~
@151  = ~No, do not answer. We can trade the tales about them after the day is done.~
@152  = ~I thought you more accommodating to what I need.~
@153  = ~Mellonamin, I loathe what this fiend has done to your gentle spirit. We will fight him, and rid the world of his pestilent presence.~
@154  = ~Yes, of course.~
@155  = ~Will you... leave again after that?~
@156  = ~(musses up your hair) Mellonamin. I will stay for as long as I am needed: to see Imoen rescued and you safe from the mage's persecutions. But after that I must go back to my people's forest.~
@157  = ~Must you? Why?~
@158  = ~You are returning there to die, aren't you?~
@159  = ~Of course. I guess I have heard the echoes of my own guilt in your words.~
@160  = ~It should not have happened to any of you. Do you know the fate of our other companions?~
@161  = ~I am glad to be of assistance, mellonamin.~
@162  = ~I do not deny that you have been hurt badly, <CHARNAME>. But you are young, skillful and have the love of your comrades. All these should count for something.~
@163  = ~Indeed, you are right. Sulking is not going to help anything.~
@164  = ~Yeah...~
@165  = ~Just leave me alone!~
@166  = ~Perhaps not. But human politics are never straightforward; they could have decided that a hero of your bloodline is inconvenient... alive. Dead heroes, those are the best sort for the governments. We should be on our guard here, too; I do not trust anyone in Athkatla.~
@167  = ~It is even easier to gather information about a foreigner from a half-hostile nation. We should be on our guard; I do not trust anyone in Athkatla.~
@168  = ~Spies are cheap everywhere. We should be on our guard; I do not trust anyone in Athkatla.~
@169  = ~I had to leave, <CHARNAME>. Surely, you do not blame me for all that had come to pass? The imprisonment, the tortures, Khalid and Dynaheir dead... (shakes his head sadly).~
@170  = ~No, of course not! Oh, Kivan, I never said any such thing. It was just a coincidence!~
@171  = ~My luck ran out the day you left my side. Please, stay with me for as long as you can. Please. I need you.~
@172  = ~I am happy that you left when you did. Kivan, I have glimpses of terrible memories. I think... I think I saw him torture the others. I would have died or given in to his demands if I saw him set a red-hot knife against your skin or aim a lightning bolt your way. I... (bit your lip) You have suffered enough.~
@173  = ~I neither understood, nor forgave you for deserting me. It will take time for me to learn to trust you again.~
@174  = ~It seems that way; the imprisonment, the torture rack, Khalid and Dynaheir dead... (shakes his head sadly) It should not have happened to any of you. Do you know the fate of our other companions?~
@175  = ~I have noticed that too, <CHARNAME> and my heart went out to you. It was you who saved them.~
@176  = ~My pride was a bad advisor. It sent me out of the safety of the city, which, after all was said and done, owed me. The Dukes would not have let the mage kidnap me so easily!~
@177  = ~I know. Well, it stinks to be me. What else is new?~
@178  = ~Thank you, Kivan. I missed your loyal companionship.~
@179  = ~You should have. The mage must have studied your every habit to be able to set up a trap like this.~
@180  = ~I suppose so. Spies are cheap in Baldur's Gate.~
@181  = ~I was not exactly a peasant. It is not difficult to gather information about someone notorious.~
@182  = ~The entire thing is in the past. Let's learn from it. We should not gawk around now, to avoid falling into a similar trap.~
@183  = ~But you did not make it. The mage must have been watching your every move carefully, if he managed to spring the trap when you were voyaging like this.~
@184  = ~I was not exactly a peasant. It is not difficult to track someone notorious.~
@185  = ~And eventually you came to the conclusion that you should leave the city?~
@186  = ~Yes. I decided to go to Candlekeep to confront Ulraunt and talk to Tethtoril.~
@187  = ~I was forced to go, rather than deciding it on my own... A letter came, summoning me to Candlekeep. I did not bother to check its authenticity; I probably should have.~
@188  = ~On the surface, Kivan, I was a celebrated hero. But I had the feeling that the moment I walked out of a room, the moment I turned my back, they started whispering ill things about me. Wondering whether I would go mad like my brother. Gossiping about my conception and heritage.~
@189  = ~I wanted to be on the road again, to adventure... I guess I got more than I bargained for.~
@190  = ~I grew more and more restless right after you went away. Nothing amused me, nothing interested me. So, I left, too.~
@191  = ~Yes, I remember how you enjoyed all the fuss around you. What made you leave the city, then?~
@192  = ~I decided to go to Candlekeep to confront Ulraunt and talk to Tethtoril.~
@193  = ~A letter came, summoning me to Candlekeep. I did not bother to check its authenticity; I probably should have.~
@194  = ~I am merry, but not stupid. On the surface, Kivan, I was a celebrated hero. But I had the feeling that the moment I walked out of a room, the moment I turned my back, they started whispering ill things about me. Wondering whether I would go mad like my brother. Gossiping about my conception and heritage.~
@195  = ~I simply had had my fill. I wanted to be on the road again, to adventure... I guess I got more than I bargained for.~
@196  = ~Well, yes, it was fun and all, but I grew restless right after you went away. Nothing amused me, nothing interested me. So, I left, too.~
@197  = ~You sound annoyed. Is this why you left the city?~
@198  = ~No, it was bearable, at times even amusing. I decided to go to Candlekeep to confront Ulraunt and talk to Tethtoril.~
@199  = ~Nope. A letter came, summoning me to Candlekeep. I did not bother to check its authenticity; I probably should have.~
@200  = ~Yes, and then thee was more. On the surface, Kivan, I was a celebrated hero. But I had the feeling that the moment I walked out of a room, the moment I turned my back, they started whispering ill things about me. Wondering whether I would go mad like my brother. Gossiping about my conception and heritage.~
@201  = ~Everything annoyed me back then! I simply wanted to be on the road again, to adventure... I guess I got more than I bargained for.~
@202  = ~I grew restless right after you went away. Nothing amused me, nothing interested me. So, I left, too.~
@203  = ~And your devotion is evident in your current excellence. What made you leave the city?~
@204  = ~On the surface, Kivan, I was a celebrated hero. But I had the feeling that the moment I walked out of a room, the moment I turned my back, they started whispering ill things about me. Wondering whether I would go mad like my brother. Gossiping about my conception and heritage.~
@205  = ~Boredom. I wanted to be on the road again, to adventure... I guess I got more than I bargained for.~
@206  = ~I grew restless right after you went away. Nothing amused me, nothing interested me. So, I left, too.~
@207  = ~I see. What made you leave the city? Boredom?~
@208  = ~No. I decided to go to Candlekeep to confront Ulraunt and talk to Tethtoril.~
@209  = ~Yes. I wanted to be on the road again, to adventure... I guess I got more than I bargained for.~
@210  = ~I wonder what have became of our other companions. Do you know their fate?~
@211  = ~I think I've told you of everyone: Minsc and Dynaheir, Jaheira and Khalid, and Imoen.~
@212  = ~Besides those who got captured with me by Irenicus? Why, whom would you like to know about?~
@213  = ~Besides those who got captured with me by Irenicus?~
@214  = ~Kivan, I've told you already, I remember next to nothing!~
@215  = ~No, mellonamin, you are no fool. Never that.~
@216  = ~And why would I possibly speak of Imoen?~
@217  = ~We should move on, I suppose.~
@218  = ~Let our spirits be unwavering and our blades sharp, my commander.~
@219  = ~You have chosen well, mellonamin. Our party is formidable.~
@220  = ~Of course. Why form attachments? One day you might have to collect a king's ransom worth of gold, or fight against overwhelming foes to save your friend. How inconvenient. A practical <PRO_MANWOMAN> like you would avoid such connections.~
@221  = ~If you are talking about Imoen -~
@222  = ~Alright, alright! You've made your point. I'm a sentimental fool, just like everyone else!~
@223  = ~Enough of this nonsense!~
@224  = ~Undoubtedly.~
@225  = ~As ours did.~
@226  = ~Yes, as ours did.~
@227  = ~Now that we have honored our former companions, it is time to rejoin our new ones.~
@228  = ~(Reach out to him with your hand, but then slowly flex your fingers, withdrawing, and lower your head for a moment.) Yes... yes, like ours did.~
@229  = ~Let all those who shed blood with us find peace and fulfillment... wherever they are.~
@230  = ~They were steadfast, and they were friends. I hope that our paths will cross once again.~
@231  = ~They'd better! I hope that none of them will end up recruited to fight against me, by chance or by design. They will make bad enemies.~
@232  = ~We're mercenaries, Kivan. It is our fate to form temporary alliances and fight for whoever has the deepest purse. Attachments would only complicate things.~
@233  = ~You're too sentimental for your own good, elf.~
@234  = ~I hope that he is content there. His was a tragic fate, first to see his clan's demise and then to be an instrument in the hands of those who would profane their memory. And Taerom Fuiruim looked like a fair master.~
@235  = ~She is certainly the most cheerful burglar I've met. I doubt that her newfound notoriety made her abandon her craft.~
@236  = ~Oh, that... dwarf.~
@237  = ~I am sure that her battle cries for Tempus still shake the skies and send her enemies to their knees.~
@238  = ~For Skie's sake, I hope that she will meet a man who would love her, not her fortune. I had no use for Eldoth.~
@239  = ~I doubt that she would ever want to live peacefully.~
@240  = ~What of our other comrades-at-arms?~
@241  = ~Shar-Teel fled Baldur's Gate swearing that she'd rather be hanged than be hailed as a hero. It did not agree with her stomach. She took enough cash to live comfortably for a year.~
@242  = ~Eldoth was doing all he could to charm Skie into marrying him, but she was devastated by her father's death.~
@243  = ~Branwen decided that serving in the Flaming Fist regiment under Angelo's successor was an honorable and glorious carrier.~
@244  = ~The last time I saw Kagain, he was wrestling with Jhasso for influence over the Iron Throne.~
@245  = ~Alora partook in every party given in our honor, which increased her girth considerably. But she still is as nimble as ever.~
@246  = ~Yeslick talked about going back to Sembia, but in the meantime he worked for Thunderhammer's Smithy. It is a fair bet that he'd stay there.~
@247  = ~I do not know what became of anyone else.~
@248  = ~If you heard anything of them, <CHARNAME>.~
@249  = ~I do not know what became of the old guard, Kivan.~
@250  = ~He can be difficult, but I would not pry further.~
@251  = ~As is the custom among our kin. I am happy for you both, <CHARNAME>, and it dispelled the uneasy feeling I had when I saw that he was not at your side.~
@252  = ~He is young.~
@253  = ~Oh, Xan. I am glad that he is doing well for himself, whether he believes it or not.~
@254  = ~Coran and Xan, if you know anything of them.~
@255  = ~Oh, Xan was serving the Dukes of Baldur's Gate, no doubt on a direct order from Evereska, and complained daily that he did not feel safe and was doomed to die away from his beloved land.~
@256  = ~I know nothing of Coran. He is probably drinking and whoring somewhere.~
@257  = ~Xan will be back soon, Kivan. Such was the intensity of our love... he wished some time to meditate on all that happened.~
@258  = ~I... I hope that Coran will find me, Kivan. And soon. I love him, despite all that has passed and despite who he is.~
@259  = ~It might be helpful if you could recount as much as possible about your captor, <CHARNAME>.~
@260  = ~I do not want to remember, Kivan. I wish to forget.~
@261  = ~How is baring my pain in front of you going to help anything?~
@262  = ~Why do you wish to stir such horrible memories, Kivan?~
@263  = ~Very well. The man's name was Jon Irenicus, and he was quite adept at casting arcane spells.~
@264  = ~Forgetting such things can be more dangerous than remembering them, <CHARNAME>.~
@265  = ~And still, I wish to forget.~
@266  = ~I did not mean for my request to come across as prying. Nor did I intend to twist a blade in your wound.~
@267  = ~We have to come prepared, and if possible, to divulge any weakness that we can exploit or even more importantly, his motives in capturing you.~
@268  = ~The Nine Hells, can't you take a hint? I will do it on my own, and I do not need your nosey help.~
@269  = ~Kivan, Irenicus is a captive of Cowled Wizards. We should be studying them, not him!~
@270  = ~I am a child of Bhaal. What other motive does one need to capture me? As for his weaknesses - there are none. He is a veritable magic powerhouse.~
@271  = ~Is that all that you remember, <CHARNAME>?~
@272  = ~Yes, that's all.~
@273  = ~He was tall and dressed oddly, in leathers bound by cords with metal ornamentations. And he wore a mask. A leather mask.~
@274  = ~You told me that he was laying waste to the Cowled Wizards and then he surrendered, before he had even a scratch. I find it very odd.~
@275  = ~Ponder on it if you wish, but ponder in silence.~
@276  = ~Nothing odd about it-it's like the wizards said; they had numbers and patience, and he was alone.~
@277  = ~I, too, found it suspicious. Now, what do I remember of him? He was tall and dressed oddly, in leathers bound by cords with metal ornamentations. And he wore a mask. A leather mask.~
@278  = ~If that is true, why would he surrender to the Cowled Wizards, and before he had even a scratch, the way you tell it. I find it very odd.~
@279  = ~Nothing odd about it-it's like the wizards said: they had numbers and patience, and he was alone.~
@280  = ~I, too, found it suspicious. Now, what do I remember of him? He was tall and dressed oddly, in leathers bound by cords with metal ornamentations. And he wore a mask. A leather mask.~
@281  = ~I agree, mellonamin. But answer one more question, for I have a strange feeling that there was an important clue in your words.~
@282  = ~Have you ever seen his face?~
@283  = ~Kivan, I was caught in pain's grasp every time he came near me! The last thing on my mind was trying to catch a glimpse of his features!~
@284  = ~No, Kivan. But I remember his hands. They were elegant, with long slender fingers...but I could see old burns, scars...very much like your hands, actually.~
@285  = ~If I did, I do not remember. What I do remember is his eyes.~
@286  = ~You are right, of course. He did not want to throw his life away. But did it mean that he had a secretive plan, or was it the act of a coward?~
@287  = ~Whatever he was, he was not a coward. Vile, yes, but not a coward... I would say that he showed little emotion, if any. Just chilly arrogance.~
@288  = ~Kivan, there is no point in second-guessing. Most likely we'll find him in chains. What is most important is to save Imoen.~
@289  = ~We will never know if we keep standing here and talking all day long.~
@290  = ~I am sorry, mellonamin. Pain etched every minute detail of my tormentors' faces in my memory. Yours was gentler.~
@291  = ~Like mine? That would make him stand out - not many live to show the marks of such a savage assault on their bodies. Do you remember more?~
@292  = ~No, nothing more.~
@293  = ~Perhaps, but I don't like the idea of standing here and talking all day long.~
@294  = ~I do remember his eyes.~
@295  = ~You saw his eyes behind the mask? Tell on, mellonamin. Were they full of yellow flame like Sarevok's? Was it his devilry?~
@296  = ~No, on the contrary, they were cold and blue. Not the faint grayish-blue of the Northmen, nor the dark blue of summer afternoons. It was a clear and perfect blue, bright and sharp.~
@297  = ~(shrug) They were light-colored. Blue, I think. Is that important?~
@298  = ~Oh, yes, they glowed like coals! Red, red, red... AAAAAA!~
@299  = ~No... There was nothing behind this mask but black emptiness.~
@300  = ~You have given me much to think about, <CHARNAME>. Let us travel on now, but we shall talk more about it. Blue eyes. Bright blue eyes... (Kivan turns away abruptly, but distress is written clearly on his face.)~
@301  = ~True enough.~
@302  = ~I do not know. There are many creatures that have blue eyes, <CHARNAME>.~
@303  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I am so sorry!~
@304  = ~It sounds ominous. A faceless man, and eyeless...~
@305  = ~One thing you have said about your captor troubles me. The eyes of clear piercing blue.~
@306  = ~Why his eye color is so important to you?~
@307  = ~And only one sentient race on Faerun has eye coloring so startling, so intense.~
@308  = ~Only our kin have eye coloring so startling, so intense.~
@309  = ~Kivan, please hold your peace.~
@310  = ~Because of all sentient races inhabiting Toril, only one has eye coloring so startling, so intense as you have described. My kin...the elves.~
@311  = ~My captor was an elf?~
@312  = ~(You look into Kivan's eyes. They are black, like liquid jet, and tilted. You perceive both their sadness and kindness. You can believe that the man who stands in front of you has lived for two and a half centuries, despite his youthful bearing.) Kivan, your eyes are nothing like his. Nothing!~
@313  = ~Even if he was an elf, why does it upset you so?~
@314  = ~Because of all sentient races inhabiting Toril, only one has eye coloring so startling, so intense as you have described. And that's our own kin...the elves.~
@315  = ~My captor was one of us? Oh, Seldarine...~
@316  = ~(You look into Kivan's eyes. They are black, like liquid jet, and tilted. You perceive both their sadness and kindness. And something beyond what words can describe, something eternal.) Kivan, your eyes are nothing like his. Nothing!~
@317  = ~So, he is our kinsman, why does it upset you so?~
@318  = ~I do not believe it, Kivan. No elf could apply such systematic, cruel pain to another elf without harming himself. And I have not felt any connection of the Spirit with Irenicus.~
@319  = ~(You take Kivan's palm and put it on your forehead; the awareness of another elf that you always feel through the Spirit becomes more focused. You can dimly distinguish Kivan's unease and worry.) Irenicus...touched me much the same way, mellonamin, but I felt no connection of the Spirit with him. He can't be an elf.~
@320  = ~Yes. My kin, the elves.~
@321  = ~Yes, he is of our own kin. Of the elves.~
@322  = ~Oh, Seldarine...~
@323  = ~It is possible. Though I pray that he is not.~
@324  = ~Why does it upset you so?~
@325  = ~Is your loyalty to your people stronger than the bond of our friendship? Are you refusing to help me avenge Khalid and Dynaheir and kill a vile man just because he is an elf?~
@326  = ~May the Seldarine be merciful and let it not be so. If our own people has forsaken their heritage so much as to torture one of their own... then the corruption of this world is truly frightening.~
@327  = ~My friend, I appreciate that you deny any resemblance between myself and your tormentor, but...~
@328  = ~(Oh, there are similarities, only you hurt my heart in a sweet way, and I want this torment to last...) But?~
@329  = ~But?~
@330  = ~Are you trying to tell me that your loyalty to your people is stronger than the bond of our friendship? Are you refusing to help me avenge Khalid and Dynaheir and kill a vile man just because he is an elf?!~
@331  = ~If my own people have forsaken their heritage so much as to torture an innocent and kill in cold blood... then the corruption of this world is truly frightening.~
@332  = ~I am sorry, Kivan...~
@333  = ~I have had enough of this elven arrogance! There are good men and vile men among elves, just like among other peoples!~
@334  = ~Please, don't take *my* tortures quite so personally. Even if the man who made me squeal with pain was an elf.~
@335  = ~Tazok was a half-ogre, right? Now I am a half-orc - his distant kin. If this Irenicus is an elf, we have a racial-torture balance of sorts here. Dunno if that would cheer you up though.~
@336  = ~If our own people have forsaken their heritage so much as to torture one of their own... then the corruption of this world is truly frightening. Oh, Seldarine...~
@337  = ~I am mistaken, then. (He sighs in relief.)~
@338  = ~O, beleger mellonamin... my brave friend. If only his touch was as gentle as yours and did not cause you so much pain. (You feel a surge of anger coming from Kivan.)~
@339  = ~I would have been more frightened if his touch was gentle, Kivan. Among N'Tel'Quess, they pervert lovers' caresses to cause pain and assert mastery. They rape, Kivan.~
@340  = ~(Reluctantly you release Kivan's hand.) What's done is done, mellonamin. The time for payback is nearing. 'Tis no use to dwell on it now.~
@341  = ~(sincerely) You presume too much, Kivan. I do not require your pity or your commiseration.~
@342  = ~(You think that this man's burden is too heavy to add your troubles. You decide to lie in order to save him from himself.) You presume too much, Kivan. I do not require your pity or your commiseration.~
@343  = ~Do you know me so little, or do you aim to offend?~
@344  = ~I will stand with you, no matter who your foe is. But if he is an elf, it is grave tidings for me.~
@345  = ~But it grieves me to learn of an elf so corrupted. I cannot deny that I greatly wish to be mistaken.~
@346  = ~But it grieves me to learn that our kinsman can be so corrupted. I cannot deny that I greatly wish to be mistaken.~
@347  = ~Why do you apologize, mellonamin? Someone committed a grave trespass against you and murdered our friends. I will see that he lives to regret it, or dies if he is unrepentant.~
@348  = ~It is personal, for a villain has murdered and harmed those who fought with me. The least I can do is to see that Irenicus lives to regret his crimes, or dies if he is unrepentant.~
@349  = ~Do not try to make light of it! Irenicus' trespasses were grave. The villain has murdered and harmed those who fought with me. The least I can do is to see that he lives to regret his crimes, or dies if he is unrepentant.~
@350  = ~(Kivan draws away from you, raw pain writ on his features.) I know that too well.~
@351  = ~I...I am glad that you were spared.~
@352  = ~Indeed, oh strong of spirit.~
@353  = ~The woodland creatures have been restored to their forest. It is good to see an evil design become undone.~
@354  = ~If only other evil things that Irenicus has done could be mended so easily!~
@355  = ~And I seem to have earned the favor of the Fairy Queen! She is beautiful.~
@356  = ~And I seem to have earned the favor of the Fairy Queen.~
@357  = ~Just another chore to please the goody two shoes who travel with me.~

@358  = ~Your approval means much to me, my honorable comrade! We shall smite Evil and thwart its plans where'er we go!~
@359  = ~Take heart, mellonamin. We are on the soul thief's trail, and you will be whole soon, just as the dryads were made whole by your efforts.~
@360  = ~Take heart, mellonamin. You will be reunited with your friend Imoen, just as the dryads were reunited with their kin by your efforts.~
@361  = ~Exercise caution, mellonamin. These beautiful creatures are carefree to a fault, and their amusements can be almost...cruel to a man they choose to toy with.~
@362  = ~These beautiful creatures are not known for their constancy, nor for their loyalty. Still, it is better to have the Fairy Queen's favor than her wrath.~
@363  = ~'Tis true, my friend.~
@364  = ~(You nod and smile privately, watching the elf through your eyelashes. If only this fairy's favor could be won by a delivery of a handful of acorns!)~
@365  = ~Well in that case, it's just another chore to please the goody two shoes who travel with me.~
@366  = ~The glorious and goodly deed needs no reward! We shall smite Evil and thwart its plans where'er we go!~
@367  = ~It always surprises me that your grumpy facade conceals a generous and bountiful heart.~
@368  = ~Your fervor is warming in a world where evil so often triumphs because so many decent people do nothing wrong...and do nothing.~
@369  = ~There is a dreamy look about you. (It sounds like a question.)~
@370  = ~A stray dream, Kivan. Nothing more.~
@371  = ~I cannot believe that a sane person would willingly deprive herself of her eyesight! A faith that demands the worshipers to be blind is an accursed one and false. <CHARNAME>, this practice should be stopped before more people are harmed.~
@372  = ~My dear friend, you are over-reacting. Remember that they claim to see a different reality, and that they do it voluntarily. It's not our place to interfere.~
@373  = ~Isn't that what all religions do? Blind the faithful at least partially and incite them to injure those who serve a different deity. Self-inflicted damage at least leaves others out of it, apart from having to look at the disfigurements.~
@374  = ~Look around us, Kivan. What do you see?~
@375  = ~I promise you, Kivan, that we shall look into this matter.~
@376  = ~In my opinion, your own devotion to Shevarash left you scarred worse than this poor sod's eye sockets are. Yet, I do not argue with your spiritual choices, mellonamin.~
@377  = ~In my opinion, your own devotion to Shevarash left you scarred worse than this poor sod's eye sockets. Yet, I do not argue with your spiritual choices, Master Elf.~
@378  = ~We were hired to investigate the Cult, Kivan, and we shall do it. Our findings will determine our actions.~
@379  = ~We should at least find out if those claims of enlightenment are authentic!~
@380  = ~And how do you propose that we go about it?~
@381  = ~If you are so eager to shed light on this matter, perhaps you should join the Cult, get your eyes removed and report back to me on the virtues and flaws of the congregation. After all, you are Mister Tortures-Do-Not-Scare-Me.~
@382  = ~We'll look into this matter, Kivan.~
@383  = ~These people are being persuaded by lies and false promises to pluck out their own eyes. And you look at it and lecture me on theology.~
@384  = ~Yes, I do. Look at me, mellonamin. I hoped that it would never come to this discussion. I sense that your devotion to Shevarash scarred you worse than this poor sod's eye sockets. Yet, I do not argue with your spiritual choices.~
@385  = ~It's funny that you of all people should say this. In my opinion, your own devotion to Shevarash left you scarred worse than this poor sod's eye sockets. Yet, I do not argue with your spiritual choices, Master Elf.~
@386  = ~You might be right. We'll look into this matter, Kivan.~
@387  = ~Temples. And down that way is the headquarters of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart.~
@388  = ~So, it is their business, not ours.~
@389  = ~And you imply that we can do more than these respectable institutions?~
@390  = ~Good. I sense evil intent behind this madness.~
@391  = ~Mellonamin, we destroyed a secretive and evil Cult that made its headquarters in the Undercity, in Baldur's Gate. This should not be much different.~
@392  = ~I endure enough in your service without being the butt of your crude jokes.~
@393  = ~Shevarash leaves scars in his wake, that much is true. But those are scars over closed wounds that bleed no more.~
@394  = ~Are you saying that Shevarash heals?~
@395  = ~There are things that are difficult to explain to a N'Tel'Quess. Perhaps my actions are unusual to your eyes, but you misjudge. Shevarash leaves scars in his wake, that much is true. But those are scars over closed wounds that bleed no more.~
@396  = ~A levelheaded answer, <CHARNAME>. Yet, I sense evil intent behind this madness, and I doubt that I am mistaken.~
@397  = ~Something has to be done, <CHARNAME>, and I don't care whose hand swings the sword that will behead this monster.~
@398  = ~Wow! You have it all figured out.~
@399  = ~In my opinion, your own devotion to Shevarash left you scarred worse than this poor sod's eye sockets. Yet, I do not argue with your spiritual choices, mellonamin.~
@400  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. I do.~
@401  = ~I promise you, Kivan, that we shall look into this matter.~
@402  = ~Kivan, we can't save everyone, especially from themselves.~
@403  = ~<CHARNAME>, I do wish that you understand my faith, but I do not like attracting attention. We can talk about it another time.~
@404  = ~I sense the workings of evil in this, <CHARNAME> .~
@405  = ~We were hired to investigate the Cult, Kivan, and we shall do it. Our findings will determine our actions.~
@406  = ~I would tell you about Shevarash, if you wish.~
@407  = ~It's not Shevarash that interests me, Kivan. It's your stubborn devotion to vengeance. Is it sweeter to seek revenge for the offences than to forgive?~
@408  = ~I would like to know more about your faith, Kivan.~
@409  = ~That is not necessary, Master Elf. I know enough about Shevarash.~
@410  = ~Some things can be neither forgiven nor forgotten, <CHARNAME>.~
@411  = ~Perhaps you are over-dramatizing the situation. I know that you've suffered, but to me it seems that you hurt yourself even more while hunting down Tazok and his cronies.~
@412  = ~When I met you, Kivan, and heard of your plight, I thought: this man will find no joy in life 'til his mortal foe lies dead at his feet. But Kivan... eternal sadness still resides in your eyes. In truth, is it vengeance that your heart desired?~
@413  = ~When I met you, Kivan, and heard of your plight, I thought: this man will find no joy in life 'til his mortal foe lies dead at his feet. But Kivan... eternal sadness still resides in your eyes. In truth, is it vengeance that your heart desired?~
@414  = ~When I met you, I thought: this man will find no joy in life 'til his mortal foe lies dead at his feet. But killing Tazok did not make you a happy man. In truth, is it vengeance that your heart desired?~
@415  = ~Maybe you are right. Maybe I just don't understand how badly you were hurt. After all, Gorion was an old man, and I knew that he would die before me. I mourned Jaheira, Khalid and Dynaheir, but... maybe it's just different for you.~
@416  = ~I lost a man who was like a father to me, and my lover, Dynaheir, in one season's turn, and still I can't understand the burning single-minded fury that moves you.~
@417  = ~Shevarash was a mortal elf who lived six thousand years ago when the star of the elves shone high and bright.~
@418  = ~The Crown Wars were over, and Ilithiry fled to the Underdark led by Lolth, to become drow. Ever since they have hated the elves more than any other race. From time to time, drow troupes would leave the deep caverns and attack the villages and cities of the elves.~
@419  = ~One such raid happened on the night of the Midwinter festival. An army of duergar and drow poured forth from the Underdark and overran both the dwarven realm of Sarphil on the southern shore of the Moonsea, and the Elven Court at the heart of the great forest of Arcorar. The Dark Court Slaughter claimed the lives of countless elves and dwarves, including most of the assembled leaders of the Fair Folk and Stout Folk who had come to the Elven Court to re-establish their long-standing alliance. Shevarash stood guard that night and fought bravely, but the attackers slaughtered many among the merrymakers, including his entire family.~
@420  = ~After that night, Shevarash prayed to Corellion and started a one-man war against drow. He attacked drow raiders on the surface and ventured into the Underdark. Eventually, he was slain by the drow, but reborn as a god of vengeance. He is tireless in his hunt for the foes of the elves. His avatars both fight drow raiders poised to attack a village and pursue the raiders to avenge the slaughtered elves when it is too late.~
@421  = ~Is it true that Sheverash never smiles?~
@422  = ~And you are setting out to follow in his footsteps? As a deity of tragic lovers?~
@423  = ~Isn't Shevarash's name among the mortals the Black Archer?~
@424  = ~That's Shevarash, Kivan. But to tell you the truth, it's your stubborn devotion to vengeance that unnerves me. Is it sweeter to seek revenge for the offences than to forgive?~
@425  = ~I have done what I must, <CHARNAME>.~
@426  = ~There was a dream that came both in reverie and in sleep.~
@427  = ~It was a memory of Deheriana's torn face as I saw it last. It was the moment when I knew that my strength had failed me, and that she would be dead when I would come to again. It was the most dreadful moment of my life.~
@428  = ~Since Tazok's death, I have not dreamed this dream.~
@429  = ~Ever since you ripped Tazok's heart from his chest, you have become more solemn, troubled. You don't look like a man who has had a heavy weight lifted from his soul.~
@430  = ~Shevarash is a cruel deity if he did this to you!~
@431  = ~(You reach for Kivan, picking just one thread, one man, in the complex tapestry of the elven communal spirit.)~
@432  = ~I am glad that you have found a small degree of consolation, Kivan, even if it baffles me that you need such violent healing.~
@433  = ~I... I do not know any more, <CHARNAME>.~
@434  = ~But there was a dream that came both in reverie and in sleep.~
@435  = ~(Look at Kivan and shake your head helplessly; you warm up to him and want to hold him, press his forehead against your shoulder. But the tall elf is too rigid and alien in his pride and grief.)~
@436  = ~It is Deheriana that my heart desires, <CHARNAME>.~
@437  = ~Ever since you ripped Tazok's heart from his chest, you have become more solemn, troubled. You don't look like a man who has had a heavy weight lifted from his heart.~

@439  = ~(You reach for Kivan, picking just one thread, one man in the complex tapestry of the elven communal spirit.)~
@440  = ~Since Tazok's death, I do not dream this dream.~
@441  = ~<CHARNAME>, it is a good thing that you do not understand.~
@442  = ~Dynaheir was a wise and kind woman. She did not allow you to bond to her.~
@443  = ~You call holding back wise? And kind?~
@444  = ~Yes, she was. I could not have loved her more if we were bonded.~
@445  = ~(smile crookedly) It was not her decision, but mine, Kivan. It felt important at the time that I did not reduce my years by bonding to a human.~
@446  = ~Bonded? I would not know how even to start!~
@447  = ~And you were bonded to Deheriana?~
@448  = ~I do not doubt your love, but N'Tel'Quess are not able to experience the connection of the elven bond.~
@449  = ~Yes. Shevarash vowed not to laugh or smile as long as the drow exist.~
@450  = ~(shiver) You're both psychotic, you and you precious Shevarash.~
@451  = ~So that's Shevarash. What about your own stubborn devotion to vengeance? Is it sweeter to seek revenge than to forgive?~
@452  = ~I have heard that Shevarash is mellowing out, seduced by Shar's promise of forgetting what was.~
@453  = ~Thank you for your insights, Kivan.~
@454  = ~No. I leave it to you to aspire to divinity.~
@455  = ~It is so.~
@456  = ~The similarities between the two of you are startling, and frankly, frightening. Is it sweeter to seek revenge than to forgive?~
@457  = ~Very interesting. Thank you for your insights, Kivan.~
@458  = ~I did what I should have done before. If my... discomfort can save other lives, I am willing to endure it.~
@459  = ~You misjudge, <CHARNAME>. Tazok was cruel, and Irenicus is cruel. Shevarash is just.~
@460  = ~(It is never easy to focus, but your efforts are rewarded by an insight into Kivan's feelings. There between rigid pride and stiff self-control, you distinguish a trickle of relief. And a whiff of warmth toward yourself.)~
@461  = ~(Before Kivan becomes aware of your searching spirit, you withdraw your attention. Your heart is lightened by what you have learned.)~
@462  = ~(You realize that in another moment, Kivan will be able to sense your searching spirit. Deep within you wells the desire to let him know how much you care.~
@463  = ~(You become curious as to how much control you can exercise; you try to overwhelm that warmth and hope with the sadness that is in abundant supply.)~
@464  = ~Consolation is all that remains to me, <CHARNAME>, if Deheriana and Arvanaith are lost.~
@465  = ~Very soon I will not need consolation, <CHARNAME>. I will behold Arvanaith.~
@466  = ~Your lover saved you centuries of life and a terrible pain of parting, <CHARNAME>. The bond has a high price for two elves, but it brings a great joy. Bonding with a N'Tel'Quess, a Tel'Quess signs his own death sentence, gaining little of the communion. It is a sign of greater love than you could imagine that she held you back, young <CHARNAME>.~
@467  = ~Of course. But mellonamin... if you ever love again, love an elf.~
@468  = ~Of course. I hope, however, that you are not playing with young Aerie's feelings.~
@469  = ~You have recovered swiftly enough from your loss, and so did Jaheira.~
@470  = ~Seems to me that you have recovered quickly from your loss thanks to the drow's... charms.~
@471  = ~You might not think so now, but... you have done the right thing. The bond has a high price for two elves, but it brings a great joy. Bonding with a N'Tel'Quess, a Tel'Quess signs his own death sentence gaining little of the communion.~

@477  = ~(Kivan shivers, and in your mind you see the walls surrounding him grow higher and thicker.)~
@478  = ~How did you know to do this, mellonamin? To heal this monster?~
@479  = ~It's the oldest trick in the book, Master Elf. Whenever a monster tells a hero that he benefits of the hero's negative emotions, a hero is strongly advised to start experiencing the emotions on the peachy-cream side of the spectrum. That way lies victory.~
@480  = ~And what am I, Kivan? If I refuse mercy to another monster, who is there to give it?~
@481  = ~Is mercy such a foreign concept to you Kivan?~
@482  = ~I just knew that it was the right thing to do.~
@483  = ~You are a nave... cynic, <CHARNAME>, if you think that you can control what you feel.~
@484  = ~ Of course one can control how one feels. Controlling others, though - now, that's more difficult. The whole school of wizardry is based around this concept and thrives. If I remember correctly, these magics come naturally to your people.~
@485  = ~Of course one can control how one feels. Controlling others, though - now, that's more difficult. The whole school of wizardry is based around this concept and thrives. Interestingly enough, our own kin excels in this field.~
@486  = ~Ah, this belief will be your undoing, Kivan. You have already let your feelings rule you with disastrous consequences.~
@487  = ~Perhaps I am. Regretfully, we can't stop here for an in-depth discussion of my fascinating personality and attitudes. Let us return to it later.~
@488  = ~It worked; so quit complaining before I get seriously annoyed.~
@489  = ~Haven't you ever heard that it's useless to swing your fists after the fight? Rightly or wrongly, I have done it: I've reined in my animosity and killed the creature with kindness. Sorry if I robbed you of the slaughter -~
@490  = ~And even a monster deserves mercy... now I see how you keep Bhaal's taint at bay, <CHARNAME>.~
@491  = ~Have I convinced you yet to follow my charitable example and bestow forgiveness and redemption? There is a nobility to it, and it is quite rewarding.~
@492  = ~I wish it was that simple. When I faced Bhaal in my dream in Spellhold, I slaughtered him, Kivan. I think that this is how I managed to stay alive.~
@493  = ~No. But when a roaring foe advances at me, I try to stop it from hurting others or myself. I do not think of anything but avoiding pain. I am a simple man, <CHARNAME>.~
@494  = ~Yes you are. Luckily, I am not so limited.~
@495  = ~I have heard that such reaction is a common consequence of tortures. You are a brave man by nature, so you will master this fear eventually.~
@496  = ~So I thought. I do not particularly honor the bard's craft, but I hope that someone will make a song out of this adventure, even if other deeds of ours are more glamorous.~
@497  = ~My people developed these magics not to manipulate others' feelings, but to avoid fighting wherever possible.~
@498  = ~I trust that you know that our kin developed these magics not to manipulate others' feelings, but to avoid fighting wherever possible.~
@499  = ~For good or ill, I always follow my heart. If death should claim me on this path - well, so be it. For it is the lowest and bitterest thing when a man betrays his own self.~
@500  = ~I will keep my thoughts to myself.~
@501  = ~You misunderstood: I was commending you on avoiding slaughter.~
@502  = ~I am neither a Painbearer nor a slave; I do not know how to forgive offenses.~
@503  = ~Simple and painless choices do not equate to the right ones, <CHARNAME>. I think you have learned this better than many by now.~
@504  = ~Yep. And I learned it the hard way, too!~
@505  = ~I question everything, Master Elf, so I won't state it quite so unambiguously.~
@506  = ~Allow me to disagree. Right choices comfort and make things simple. The wrong ones complicate matters.~
@507  = ~Fear, <CHARNAME>?~
@508  = ~Yes, Kivan, fear. There is no shame in it. The methodically applied pain of a torture rack is designed to break a man. Like me, you have known that moment when you'd have given anything for the pain to stop... a broken man becomes a coward - at least, for a time.~
@509  = ~Yes, Kivan, fear. There is no shame in it. The methodically applied pain of a torture rack is designed to break a man... or a woman. Like me, you have known that moment when you'd have given anything for the pain to stop... a broken person becomes a coward - at least, for a time.~
@510  = ~Think about it, Kivan, and look into your heart. Perhaps you will see how frightened you are of being captured by another Tazok. So frightened that you believe it a good thing to kill anyone who resembles him in the least. So frightened that you have given over your spirit to grim Shevarash.~
@511  = ~I am just succumbing to neurasthenia, Kivan.~
@512  = ~Perhaps you can even make a song yourself. (He smiles lightly.) Since we first met, you have become half-decent.~
@513  = ~(snicker) Coming from you, it is a high compliment. Very well, I will make a song.~
@514  = ~Half-decent, huh.~
@515  = ~Harder to learn, harder to forget, <CHARNAME>.~
@516  = ~N'Tel'Quess see fewer colors than the elves, but surely not just black and white?~
@517  = ~Mellonamin, we have the keenest eyes of all races. Why do you insist that there are just black and white when Quenya has eighty-six words for the shades of grey alone?~
@518  = ~I have to think about what you have just said, <CHARNAME>. It does not taste like fear, but perhaps it is a different sort of fear.~
@519  = ~No woman should be subjected what Irenicus had done to you!~
@520  = ~And what do you need with such a cowardly creature as you have described me?~
@521  = ~I did not mean to offend. I wish to help you to exorcise your demons, Master Elf. That's all.~
@522  = ~I have said it all wrong. I am sorry.~
@523  = ~Since you've asked, the only thing I want with you is to have you. I will not rest till you come to me and we make passionate love in some exuberantly romantic setting. If only you weren't so gorgeous, I wouldn't endure your moodiness and awkward ways.~
@524  = ~Your bow, elf. What else?~
@525  = ~Then we must go. Work is the best cure for it.~
@526  = ~You have strange thoughts, <CHARNAME>.~
@527  = ~I love but one woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@528  = ~Me?~
@529  = ~Deheriana?~
@530  = ~Well, a girl is not a wall. She'd move.~
@531  = ~(You hang your head.) I knew it!~
@532  = ~(Kivan looks at you strangely and shakes his head in dismay.)~
@533  = ~Caution is an admirable trait.~
@534  = ~And the one I would have loved you to learn from, <CHARNAME> the Shooting Star.~
@535  = ~If I were cautious, Everbloom, I would not have you walking here telling me to learn caution.~
@536  = ~I would not want to lose you again, Kivan.~
@537  = ~We will not be apart again, Deheriana. Wherever you go, I shall follow you.~
@538  = ~(Kivan walks over to Tazok's dead body and stares at it for a long moment. A chilling look comes into his eyes.)~
@539  = ~Kivan?~
@540  = ~(When Kivan finally speaks, his voice is hoarse.)~
@541  = ~<CHARNAME>, I do not expect you to understand what I am about to do. But I must do it.~
@542  = ~Do *what*?!~
@543  = ~Kivan, you are scaring me.~
@544  = ~I will not understand? Try me.~
@545  = ~I am going to cut Tazok's heart out of his chest and keep it.~
@546  = ~Much as I am reluctant to see a corpse mutilation, I understand your reasons. May the Seldarine have mercy on you.~
@547  = ~Much as I am reluctant to see a corpse mutilation, I understand your reasons. May the gods have mercy on you.~
@548  = ~Will you at least, er... pickle or smoke it or something? 'Cause a foul half-ogre's heart is still a chunk of meat, and when it starts to rot, no posy will save us from the stench.~
@549  = ~Do you have to have this trophy?~
@550  = ~Why would you want to do such a thing?~
@551  = ~Say no more, and do what you must.~
@552  = ~OK, you can have the heart, but the liver and brain are mine! The guy annoyed me at least as much as he annoyed you! Then we can chop the rest of the body into strips or dice it or something. So, what are we waiting for? (Heaving a handy cutting edged weapon, you rush toward the body.)~
@553  = ~Will you be harmed by your actions?~
@554  = ~I am scarring myself, <CHARNAME>, but I see no other choice.~
@555  = ~<CHARNAME>, friend and comrade at arms. Forgive me for being curt, but I do not want to explain myself just now.~
@556  = ~Thank you, mellonamin.~
@557  = ~(Elven runes catch light and glow along the edge of a long-bladed dagger as Kivan expertly cuts the leather bands holding the heavy plate in place, the padding, and finally the leather jerkin. Dark blood soaks everything, making the coarse hair on Tazok's chest look like tufts of grass in a bog. Kivan hesitates for a moment, then closes his eyes. He sings a prayer to Shevarash, and then jams his dagger deep between massive ribs.)~
@558  = ~(The elf's slender hands become coated in fresh blood as he labors, breaking through flesh and bone.)~
@559  = ~(Finally, with a shriek, he holds his hand up, squeezing a dark chunk of meat looking much like a belt pouch with lots of red strings leaking scarlet fluid. Thick bands of Tazok's heart's blood worm their way down to Kivan's elbow.)~
@560  = ~(Turn away, trying not to gag.)~
@561  = ~Put that bloody thing away! Now!~
@562  = ~(You look at the scene emotionlessly.)~
@563  = ~I assure you that no discomfort or harm will come to you or our companions.~
@564  = ~(nod) Then go ahead.~
@565  = ~And what about yourself? Will you be harmed?~
@566  = ~A trophy?! <CHARNAME>, I am taking it to make another resurrection of this monster impossible. I...~
@567  = ~I am taking Tazok's heart to make another resurrection of this monster impossible. Anyone who wants to resurrect him will have to wrestle the heart from me first.~

@573  = ~Must you spoil all the fun? Oh, have it your way...~
@574  = ~Bah. Pretty words don't turn one thing to another. Do your butchery and enjoy it... and let others enjoy it too!~
@575  = ~(Kivan drops the heart and makes a move as to shield his eyes. Blood smears his forehead as his hand drops to his side.) A moment... please.~
@576  = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. What I am about to do is a sacrilege unworthy of the ranger's creed. Anyone who wants to resurrect him will have to wrestle the heart from me first, so I must fight their ill will. But I am prepared to face both evils if I can prevent Tazok from walking the woods again, savaging the innocents.~
@577  = ~Kivan, no! I forbid it. I will not have Firkraags and Sarevoks of this world coming after you. Keeping Tazok dead is not worth losing you!~
@578  = ~You seem to know the consequences well. (nod) Go ahead.~
@579  = ~Unworthy of a ranger? Then do not do it. Do not let Tazok destroy you so completely. Do not turn into Tazok.~
@580  = ~Kivan, I am no ranger. Mutilating the corpse will not compromise my honor. Allow me to do this thing for the sake of our friendship.~
@581  = ~Arwen en amin... my lady. Your compassion touches me, but I must end this murderous thing.~
@582  = ~If it is unworthy of a ranger to mutilate a corpse, then do not do it. Do not let Tazok destroy you so completely. Do not turn into Tazok.~
@583  = ~(Kivan looks at you strangely and shivers.)~
@584  = ~Simple words and true. Let us leave this foul place quickly.~
@585  = ~I will not have you foul yourself with...~
@586  = ~(Kivan stops abruptly and closes his eyes.)~
@587  = ~And neither should I let myself do it. Let us leave this vile place quickly, before evil thoughts poison my mind again.~
@588  = ~<CHARNAME>, we have forgotten again to buy dried fruits. It must be the thirty-seventh time -~
@589  = ~No, thirty-sixth. Thirty-sixth...~
@590  = ~Kivan? Kivan! You are drifting away.~
@591  = ~So? We'll buy them the next time. No need to cry over it.~
@592  = ~I was going to collect local roots and berries instead. Just to do something... something peaceful for once.~
@593  = ~Hey, I did not forget it to slight you! When I am buying food, that stuff is the last thing I worry about. I am not a fruit-fly, you know.~
@594  = ~Actually, I did not. You did not look carefully enough.~
@595  = ~ How much further must I travel, how much longer will I continue to wander? How long have I not dared to dream of my future, to dream no further than the next moonrise?!~
@596  = ~(A sudden fury rises in Kivan's voice.) So is this our true destiny?! To wander the wide world, homeless? Will we battle evil creatures and men forever?~
@597  = ~Ouch! Er... Continue drifting away, Kiv.~
@598  = ~Kivan, you can go back to Shilmista any time you wish. Your debt to me has been fulfilled threefold by now.~
@599  = ~I... I do not know, Kivan.~
@600  = ~Is not that what you want?~
@601  = ~Next time... there is always the next time to restock the backpacks, to roll up bedrolls and move towards the next place.~
@602  = ~Mellonamin, if only you knew how your words resonate in my chest. To do something peaceful...~
@603  = ~(Kivan pats you on your shoulder.) Not a fruit-fly, but a great hero... Let us try to buy some gentler fare than salted meats next time.~
@604  = ~I am sorry, mellonamin, I have not found it. I am... I am tired.~
@605  = ~Shilmista... Shilmista is empty without Deheriana.~
@606  = ~I am afraid that I do know that it is our doom.~
@607  = ~By Seldarine, no! All I want is Deheriana...~
@608  = ~<CHARNAME>, we are both no strangers to love and loss.~
@609  = ~Kivan, I'd rather not talk about it.~
@610  = ~Yes, but who isn't?~
@611  = ~I have never loved a woman... at least not as strongly as you loved Deheriana.~
@612  = ~I have never loved a man... at least not as strongly as you loved Deheriana.~
@613  = ~I have never loved a man... at least not as strongly as Deheriana loved you.~
@614  = ~To love, to loss, to battles, to roads, to scrolls, to making enemies, to making friends... In short, on the deathbed we can say that we lived, not merely existed.~
@615  = ~Love and loss... I wager that you are one of those who believes that it's better to love and to lose than to never have loved at all.~
@616  = ~Do you think that staying silent will make it go away? Then you are mistaken!~
@617  = ~I would be a fool to think that my pain would just go away. But it belongs in my heart. It will benefit no one if I was to go around spilling my innermost feelings to everyone, like a drunk.~
@618  = ~No, Kivan. I just want some peace and quiet.~
@619  = ~Yes, damn you, YES!~
@620  = ~('Oh, irony. Should I talk about my love to you, I would likely lose you...' then, out loud:) Kivan, it is complicated.~
@621  = ~Some cry, others laugh or do fey things to cope. But why? Has it ever helped anyone?~
@622  = ~(worriedly) Kivan, are you ill? Are your wounds festering? You sound and, for that matter, look feverish.~
@623  = ~After Gorion died, I did not cry. But finally, many nights later, the tears came, and brought relief.~
@624  = ~Love can heal the pain of loss.~
@625  = ~I am not the one to guess why others do what they do. Though I wish Jaheira would find a different way to cope with her grief, rather than turning ever more sour.~
@626  = ~I think it must help, since people keep trying it.~
@627  = ~Is it better to surrender and just live in some sort of stupor? Never feel, never become attached...~
@628  = ~Is it caution or chance?~
@629  = ~Caution. I have seen what love does to people.~
@630  = ~Chance. I haven't met my Deheriana yet.~
@631  = ~Perhaps both. Perhaps neither. I haven't given it a thought. But while we are on the subject, you must be one who believes that it's better to love and to lose than to never have loved at all.~
@632  = ~It is so strange to hear that from you. It is as if... as if...~
@633  = ~Well, tell me when you can express your doubtlessly deep thoughts.~
@634  = ~(with a small smile) ...as if you two were heroes from a legend or a bard's song?~
@635  = ~As if?~
@636  = ~As she still loves me, I hope.~
@637  = ~Do you think that old Jessup, who no doubt spent all of his life studying scrolls in Candlekeep library, had a lesser life than you?~
@638  = ~Kivan, you met Jessup for a brief moment, and you presume to judge? For your information, the old scoundrel had his share of adventures.~
@639  = ~I don't know. I just know that I am grateful for the day when my life was all turned upside down. I would trade two lives of a monk in Candlekeep for one of an adventurer!~
@640  = ~No, no. I spoke before thinking. To each his own.~
@641  = ~Your words surprise me. Surely, you are one of those who believes that it's better to love and to lose than to never have loved at all.~
@642  = ~So you believe in silence.~
@643  = ~Some cry, others laugh or do fey things to cope. But why? Has it ever helped anyone?~
@644  = ~(Remain demonstratively silent to show that this conversation is over.) ~
@645  = ~I think it must since people keep trying it.~
@646  = ~I wish sometimes that it were simple. That there was one sure way. But there is none.~
@647  = ~Some wounds never heal.~
@648  = ~Oh, bugger off!~
@649  = ~You think so? After Gorion died, I did not cry. But finally, many nights later, the tears came, and they brought relief.~
@650  = ~ Love can heal the pain of loss, if your ailment is one of the heart.~
@651  = ~*Something* must help, since people keep trying to move on.~
@652  = ~So should we surrender and just live in some sort of stupor? Never feel, never become attached...~
@653  = ~You are a lucky <PRO_MANWOMAN>, if tears washed away your grief.~
@654  = ~The more you love someone, the more you give to them of your own heart, of your own spirit. And the more you take of theirs, until it is difficult to even remember how your heart beat before falling in love.~
@655  = ~And then you are torn apart and the one who lived is left standing with a gaping hole in the very middle of his or her being.~
@656  = ~Wait! If what you are saying is true, then theoretically the one left to live should be whole by the virtue of keeping part of his lover's essence.~
@657  = ~That's horrible!~
@658  = ~If you are referring to Jaheira and yourself, I cannot commend this way of consoling a dead friend's wife.~
@659  = ~I knew Khalid better than you did. He was a noble and kind man. I think he is happier to see Jaheira loved and in love again, rather than locked in fruitless bitter faithfulness to him.~
@660  = ~I know that you and Khalid had been close, but I had never come to care for the man, let alone call him a friend. Let it be my loss.~
@661  = ~The truth is, my stubborn elf, that Khalid did not deserve a single hair from her head, let alone her heart.~
@662  = ~You do not understand what is happening to her, <CHARNAME>.~
@663  = ~Wait! If what you are saying is true, the one left to live should be whole by the virtue of keeping part of his lover's essence.~
@664  = ~You think that a heart could be mended like a tattered cloak?~
@665  = ~Wait! If what you are saying is true then theoretically the one left to live should be whole by the virtue of keeping part of his lover's essence.~
@666  = ~Perhaps there is simply no choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@667  = ~It is so strange to hear this from someone. It is as if we were heroes from an old tale.~
@668  = ~Yeah, well, over time your constant whining over Deheriana compounded to reach monumental proportions. By extension, your love for her must have been 'bout fifteen on the scale of one to ten, if that grief is but a derivative. In short, 'twas mythical.~
@669  = ~Hmmm... perhaps it was an awkward thing to say.~
@670  = ~From all people I know you come to mind when one talks about a man in love with a woman.~
@671  = ~I am. But the price is high.~
@672  = ~Yeah, well, over time your constant whining over Deheriana compounded to reach monumental proportions. By extension, your love for her must have been 'bout fifteen on the scale of one to ten, if all that angst is but a derivative. In short, 'twas mythical.~
@673  = ~Your grief touches my heart more than any story ever could.~
@674  = ~As if we were heroes from an old tale.~
@675  = ~I have misjudged then.~
@676  = ~The price can be high... very high.~
@677  = ~(in exasperation) And I thought we had finally moved away from talking about love and broken hearts. I should have known better!~
@678  = ~Indeed.~
@679  = ~No. I do not think so. Or rather I hope that it is not so. I wish an easier fate for Deheriana.~
@680  = ~It is the flipside of happiness.~
@681  = ~Indeed, if staying true to the one you love turns you bitter, there is nothing you can do but to run into the arms of the next lover.~
@682  = ~It *is* your loss. Perhaps if you had known him better you would not have been so quick to take his place in bed before it even cooled.~
@683  = ~Shut up! You know NOTHING!~
@684  = ~Kivan, insulting both Jaheira and myself is not going to restore Khalid from the dead.~
@685  = ~I have no desire to argue about it, but I know in my heart that we have done nothing wrong.~
@686  = ~If Jaheira shared your point of view, you two would have truly deserved each other. As it stands, for her sake, keep this 'opinion' to yourself, boy.~
@687  = ~It is awkward, <CHARNAME>. Your star shines brightly, bringing all of us into the spotlight. I fear that none of your companions shall be spared great fame.~
@688  = ~If I have to be remembered, that is not the worst thing to be remembered for.~
@689  = ~I love someone, just like countless others do, <CHARNAME>. Mine is a tale that happens every day.~

@695  = ~When I told Gorion that I shall not be harnessed by his rigid set of morals. I was rather young then.~

@701  = ~There was no moment like this in my life. The realization seeped into me as I adventured along the Sword Coast.~
@702  = ~I must have known it very early, because even in my earliest memories I felt compelled and ready to oppose it.~

@708  = ~I am talking about pure, unmistakable, inexplicable evil.~
@709  = ~Such does not exist. Yep, I have seen ugly monsters aplenty... But pure evil? Nah.~
@710  = ~Well, I felt that I had encountered such a malevolent force when Gorion died on Sarevok's sword.~
@711  = ~My encounters with pure evil? Let me see. When I learned that it was Bhaal who sired me by raping my mother, that should certainly qualify.~
@712  = ~I felt evil breathing down my neck when I had to kill Sarevok, my brother.~
@713  = ~My closest brush with evil was when Irenicus started 'experimenting' on me.~

@715  = ~I am not an idiot to make myself a hated <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I have had a taste of the prison in Baldur's Gate.  I have had a death sentence placed on me. I did not care much for the experience. One must amass considerable power before <PRO_HESHE> can do as <PRO_HESHE> pleases.~
@716  = ~(You shrug.) I am a contradictory person, I suppose.~
@717  = ~My Sire's taint is strong with me, but I fight it however I can. I cannot help what I think or what I feel, but I can do what people consider 'good' things. Perhaps they will forgive me my inner 'evil' for it.~
@718  = ~Say, Kivan, what about yourself? When did you first come to realize that evil is near?~
@719  = ~You are a wretched creature, <CHARNAME>. I cannot help but wonder if the good you do is done by caprice or is it a part of greater devious design.~
@720  = ~It was an act of hatred and madness that killed your foster father.~
@721  = ~I had my father along when I came face to face with evil for the first time.~
@722  = ~Perhaps it is a part of such experiences to realize that your family can not keep you safe.~
@723  = ~Tell me about your first brush with evil, Kivan.~
@724  = ~Yes, perhaps. But it is such an unsettling topic. Let us talk about something else. Or, even better, let us go.~
@725  = ~That *nobody* can keep us safe... Sad, but true.~
@726  = ~A nightmare that would cow even a fearless <PRO_MANWOMAN> like you,  to be sure.~
@727  = ~At least my father stood by my side when I first faced the bitter vileness that plagues our world.~
@728  = ~It is such an unsettling topic. Let us talk about something else. Or, even better, let us go.~
@729  = ~Your father was with you? I hope that he was not slaughtered in front of you, like Gorion...~
@730  = ~I still regret my failing to see you through that horrific experience. You have told me that you felt like a kinslayer, but all I could think about was Tazok...~
@731  = ~Forgive me the abrupt departure after we had defeated Sarevok, and the callousness of my choice, mellonamin.~
@732  = ~Apologies accepted. But tell me about your first brush with evil, Kivan.~
@733  = ~You gave no offence, Kivan. Those were trying times for both of us. And, my friend...  with the best intentions, you could not keep me safe. Nobody can keep me safe - this is perhaps the bitterest lesson I have learned then. My own brother wanted my head. My own brother. And I've killed him.~
@734  = ~I still regret my failing to be by your side when you needed another sword more than ever.~
@735  = ~You gave no offence, Kivan. Those were trying times for both of us. And, my friend...  with the best intentions, you could not keep me safe. Nobody can keep me safe - this is perhaps the bitterest lesson I have learned.~
@736  = ~I see. It was very different for me. It was a revelation.~
@737  = ~How did it happen? If you don't mind me asking.~
@738  = ~Your virtue, determination and awareness shows so clearly the flaws of my own kin.~
@739  = ~I was neither expecting it nor was I ready. It was a revelation.~
@740  = ~You are a very different person than I. I was neither expecting evil to push its way into my life nor ready to face it. Yet I knew it and hated it for what it was. It was a revelation.~
@741  = ~You are a narrow-minded, self-righteous person, Kivan. It is useless to try to explain to you that there is a higher set of morals.~
@742  = ~You are neither of those things, <CHARNAME>, as you proved again and again.~
@743  = ~Ah, Kivan, Kivan. You are quite naive. But enough of that. Tell me, what about yourself? When did you first come to realize that evil is near?~
@744  = ~I have no desire to witness you achieve this horrible goal. I was wrong to return, but I shall not compound this mistake by staying any longer.~
@745  = ~That you are. I hope that the good in you will triumph over evil.~
@746  = ~<CHARNAME>, I think you are confusing callous thoughts many a youth have with evil.~
@747  = ~It neither does good, nor cares of the others' opinion and forgiveness.~
@748  = ~Thank you, Kivan. It heartens me to know that you do not disparage me. Perhaps I indeed did  not understand what it is... the Evil. When did you first come to realize that it is near?~
@749  = ~It happened long ago. I had barely turned seventy-two when I asked my father, Echtellion, to cut and bend my first man's bow to replace the boy's curved hunting bow I had. Despite my youth, I was quickly gaining in strength and it looked like I would not grow much taller.  My fingers were nimbler before Tazok's men broke them, and due to that my aim was truer even than now. So my father agreed.~
@750  = ~In my family, the wood of choice was not yew, so loved by many archers, but the white ash that grows sometimes between the dark firs and pines of the Snowflake Mountains. My father had gathered the potions and minor enchantments that make the living wood bend and shape in a short week instead of years, and on we went.~
@751  = ~We traveled high into the mountains beyond the boundaries of King Galladel's realm. I rarely had an opportunity before to walk alone with my father, as I was the most aloof of my siblings. I enjoyed the effortless and non-constricted closeness we shared. Finally, with spells and songs my first bow was made and the matching white arrows fletched with white goose feathers. It was beautiful. It was also more powerful, or I was less strong, than I had expected. I did not tell my father, but it took all of my might just to string it.~
@752  = ~He understood it, I think, because he said that we should wait until we found a clearing to try out the aim and range of the weapon. He hoped that I would get less excited and fearful of failure by then. Emotions are an archer's worst enemy.~
@753  = ~We both knew one such clearing at the borders of the elven lands and there we went, descending to the forest floor from the mountains.~
@754  = ~What we did not know was that an elven patrol had chosen the clearing to stop for the night or that it was attacked by a score of orcs.~
@755  = ~A feeling of terrible wrongness swept over me before I even saw the five mutilated bodies of my kinsmen among the dead orcs and the remnants of the victor's revolting orgy. My father himself was shocked into silence, and stood dumbstruck. A testimony to how badly the patrol was outnumbered was the precise cuts that killed two patrolwomen: despite many other wounds they bore, there was no doubts that this was the last favor from their fighting comrades to spare them the horrors of being captured alive.~
@756  = ~No matter how hard I tried, I could not have imagined what it felt like to be forced to slay your own, against the revulsion of the Spirit, against every instinct of camaraderie or love. (quietly) And I still do not know, for I have failed to give this last mercy to Deheriana.~
@757  = ~After a while, my father came to his senses and ordered me to turn away. There was little the two of us could do but to return to the village and bring more people to give the patrol the proper burial.~
@758  = ~So we ran. Soon it became obvious from the tracks that we were gaining on three of the orcs who did not return to the mountains, but ventured deeper into the forest either in search of more prey or scouting the reaches.~
@759  = ~We could easily have outrun them, but my father had death in his eyes. Like a shadow we stalked the orcs, until he found his opportunity. He had killed the first monster before he knew it. The other two charged him.~
@760  = ~So I picked up my boy's bow and joined the fight. It was not until few years later that I could pull my Ashenbow without straining my muscles.~
@761  = ~But when a man sees evil, what choice does he have but to fight? Even if he wields a broom handle.~
@762  = ~I feel that there is more to this story than you've just told, Kivan.~
@763  = ~Quite a tale that was.~
@764  = ~Thank you for sharing, Kivan.~
@765  = ~I wish that I had fought by Gorion's side on the fateful night when he was murdered! Then things might have turned out very differently then.~
@766  = ~(yawn) What-bloody-ever.~
@767  = ~So, how did you first come to realize that the evil is near?~
@768  = ~(Just nod your agreement.)~
@769  = ~No. I deem myself lucky that I did not witness my father's death. He burned in the magical fires summoned forth by the wizard Dorigen of the Castle Trinity...~
@770  = ~I am sorry to hear it. (You shiver.) A horrible death.~
@771  = ~(Kivan places his hand on your shoulder in a silent show of support.)~
@772  = ~(Shake his hand roughly off your shoulder.) I do not need your pity!~
@773  = ~We will try, <CHARNAME>. We will try.~
@774  = ~Yes, there is, but we have talked for a long time, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps you can remind me later to tell you the rest.~
@775  = ~Sarevok would have killed you, <CHARNAME>. He was a powerful man. In the Undercity, we had to do everything possible and impossible to defeat him. He would have killed you...~
@776  = ~<CHARNAME>, I need... Can we talk for a moment? (Kivan looks troubled, that is, if granite can look troubled.)~
@777  = ~(You reach to him through the Elven Spirit.)~
@778  = ~Kivan, are you well?~
@779  = ~O, look at you! All pale and ready to faint! What are you doing to yourself, Kivan?~
@780  = ~It came to pass that Rhutderik, son of Merodfin came of an age, but his marriage was not arranged yet. So his father, a great lord in the far away land of Rashemen, bade him to search for a maiden both virtuous and fair.~
@781  = ~(start singing)

I am a master of tales, I know my craft.
I know tales of baleful foxes and fearful doves
Of princes in castles and poisoned gloves...

But the fire burns higher, eh higher, eh higher
And the sparks go flyin', a flyin', a flyin'
My voice is hoarse with wine, eh wine, eh wine
I forget every tale of mine, o' mine, o' mine
I was writin' them down, oh down , oh down...
I was thinking that one day, oh one day, oh one day

That someday all my tales will happen to pass
But the fairy tales aren't springing to life
I am a master of tales, I know my craft...

...an old master of tales, I know my craft...~
@782  = ~Two orcs were walking home from a raid when they came across the severed head of an orc on the road. One picked up the head and exclaimed to the other, "Hey, that looks like Krurg!" The other orc looked at the head and said, "Nah. Krurg was taller than that."~
@783  = ~(You sense something cold and cruel surrounding Kivan, trying to dominate him. Against it, Kivan has but determination. His spirit trembles and shines like a taut string of a bow in the sunlight.)~
@784  = ~O, Kivan! What is this thing?!~
@785  = ~You wanted a tale? Well... (cough) It came to pass that Rhutderik, son of Merodfin came of an age, but his marriage was not arranged yet. So his father, a great lord in the far away land of Rashemen, bade him to search for a maiden both virtuous and fair.~
@786  = ~No... No. But it should pass. Just distract me for a moment.~
@787  = ~It came to pass that Rhutderik, son of Merodfin came of an age, but his marriage was not arranged yet. So his father, a great lord in the far away land of Rashemen, bade him to search for a maiden both virtuous and fair.~

@789  = ~Do not worry, mellonamin.~
@790  = ~It... it should pass. Just distract me for a moment.~
@791  = ~Don't you 'mellonamin' me and then retreat into your shell. What *is* wrong?~
@792  = ~I am a healer, Kivan, not a storyteller. Let me help you my own way: tell me what is wrong or let me delve you to find the injury.~
@793  = ~Do I look like a wet nurse to you? O, Nine Hells, did you people elect me to be the 'crying shoulder' of the company?!~
@794  = ~(Kivan cringes and sways.)~
@795  = ~I am sorry, mellonamin. It is a good tale, but listening about brave heroes and fair maidens is not enough to... to quell it.~
@796  = ~Will this be enough? (You take Kivan's head firmly in your hands and plant a kiss on his lips.)~
@797  = ~Will you tell me what is wrong with you, proud elf?~
@798  = ~Is there anything else I could do for you then?~
@799  = ~A good song, master bard -~
@800  = ~I am sorry, mellonamin. It is worse than I thought, and a song is not enough to quell it.~
@801  = ~I had not heard you singing before, mellonamin.~
@802  = ~(Kivan smiles faintly then cringes and sways.)~
@803  = ~I probably should not have told you this joke. It's hardly your cup of tea, orcs' raids and all...~
@804  = ~Tazok... Or essence of Tazok, his soul... or what this beast has for his soul.~
@805  = ~Ever since I have taken his heart, it has been tormenting me, his voice growing louder and louder.~
@806  = ~No wonder that you have been talking of loss and pain and evil lately!~
@807  = ~Just throw the horrible thing away.~
@808  = ~What are you going to do?~
@809  = ~No, no. I am more stouthearted than that. It is just... it is worse than I thought, and your kind intervention is not enough to quell it.~
@810  = ~ Ever since I have taken Tazok's heart, his voice has been tormenting me, and it is growing louder and louder...~
@811  = ~I can only guess that it is his essence, his soul... or whatever this beast has for a soul, taking its revenge on me.~
@812  = ~Tazok is taking revenge on *you*? Ironic, is not it?~
@813  = ~I think that this injury is beyond your skill.~
@814  = ~(Kivan takes your hands in his and returns them to your sides.)~
@815  = ~This is not - ~
@816  = ~<CHARNAME>, ever since I have taken Tazok's heart his voice was tormenting me, and it is growing louder and louder...~
@817  = ~(Kivan takes your right hand in his, and kisses it lightly. Then he returns it to your side, handling you as gently as you were a fragile, precious object.)~
@818  = ~I do not know.~
@819  = ~Yes. He makes me relive the darkest days of my life and he laughs... and my soul becomes invaded by hurtful thoughts.~
@820  = ~I am not going to be defeated that easily.~
@821  = ~Then fight on.~
@822  = ~We have fought many a battle shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow. I am with you in this. (You put your arm against Kivan's shoulder.) I stand ready.~
@823  = ~Fight.~
@824  = ~Yes, it is wildly amusing.~
@825  = ~(Kivan nods and his face assumes an expression of ultimate concentration.)~
@826  = ~(Kivan leans against you heavily and his face assumes an expression of ultimate concentration.)~
@827  = ~It is a beautiful bit of the forest. Look at those trees, <CHARNAME>! They are living columns in a temple the likes of which even Tel'Quess cannot build.~
@828  = ~(sigh) Well, go hug 'em trees. I bet they are all your friends.~
@829  = ~Trees are trees are trees, Kiv.~
@830  = ~I am confused and conflicted. I thought that the elves... pardon me, *Tel'Quess*, build their great cities to match the natural marvels. In fact, poor Faldorn used to make a big deal out of it, back when she was short listing the civilizations that should be wiped out immediately, as opposed to all the rest that should follow soon after.~
@831  = ~Yes, this grove has a special sort of beauty to it. I am glad to see it in better hands than Shadow Druids'.~
@832  = ~I am looking, Kivan. This one has particularly nice er... leaves.~
@833  = ~(You stop, close your eyes and breath in the fragrances of the sentient woods.) So good...~
@834  = ~Uhm... if you say so.~
@835  = ~We have just killed someone I knew, Kivan. I am in no mood to enjoy the scenery!~
@836  = ~The beauty of the heart of the forest is such that it almost moves me to cry and makes me wonder if sap shall flow from my eyes, in place of tears.~
@837  = ~You say it in jest, but in truth some trees can become your friends and even comrades at arms.~
@838  = ~Yes, yes. I've heard about treants. Now let us get out of here, before we meet some.~
@839  = ~That's it. You've lost the last of your god-damned mind!~
@840  = ~What?!~
@841  = ~We have just killed someone I knew, Kivan. I am in no mood for talking about trees, either evil or benign.~
@842  = ~Some trees can become your friends and even comrades at arms.~
@843  = ~Can you imagine anything that is more elegant than a silver birch or mightier than an oak tree, more delicate than a snowdrop flower?~
@844  = ~Yes, as a matter of fact, I can.~
@845  = ~No, I guess not.~
@846  = ~Yes it is fortunate that this marvelous place is not a scene of slaughter anymore.~
@847  = ~It reminds me of Syldritch Trea, a sacred grove in my native forest of Shilmista.~
@848  = ~I am sure it would. Both are groves. With trees. And grass. And bugs. And... er... other foresty stuff.~
@849  = ~Tell me about Syldritch Trea, Kivan.~
@850  = ~So it does. (Kivan smiles privately.) Some trees can become your friends and even comrades at arms.~
@851  = ~(Kivan is silent for a long moment, allowing you to enjoy the fresh cool air.)~
@852  = ~It is fortunate that this marvelous place is not a scene of slaughter anymore.~

@854  = ~(You nod and with a sigh of regret resume your course. Time waits on no <PRO_MANWOMAN>.)~

@857  = ~I, too, mourn Faldorn's descent into madness, and her death.~
@858  = ~I only wished to remind you that there is good in this world. Too often I forget it myself, and you did me the kindness of pointing it out a few times before.~
@859  = ~I was merely returning a favor.~
@860  = ~There is an oak grove in Shilmista. The youngest sapling there is centuries old, and the elders remember when all of these lands, from the sea to Tethyr and beyond, were covered by the great forest of Cormanthyr.~
@861  = ~Our legends told us that in the hour of need, the trees of our forest could be awoken and they would fight with us.~
@862  = ~So when our lands seemed to be lost to the hordes of orcs sent forth by Castle Trinity, Prince Elbereth and a human, Cadderly of Carradoon, came to Syldritch Trea in desperate hope and sang to the trees.~

@869  = ~There is an oak grove, known as Sildrich Trea. The youngest sapling there is centuries old, and the elders remember when all of these lands, from the sea to Tethyr and beyond, were covered by the great forest of Cormanthyr.~

@871  = ~I am troubled with Faldorn's descent into madness.~
@872  = ~Faldorn? Who's Faldorn?~
@873  = ~Bah, she was always a nutcase, that one.~
@874  = ~It is sad. I feel somewhat guilty about her fall...~
@875  = ~Faldorn herself did not see it that way, Kivan. Fanatics like her take it for wisdom.~
@876  = ~Her madness, though... there had been something attractive about it. Something holy.~
@877  = ~I thought that you remembered her, as you had mentioned her name the other day.~
@878  = ~We met her in Cloakwood Forest among the Shadow Druids. She wished us to destroy the mines there.~
@879  = ~Heh, with that beating Irenicus gave me it's all kinda hazy. She's always been a nutcase, wasn't she?~
@880  = ~O, yes, yes. I remember her now. It's sort of sad. I feel guilty about her fall...~
@881  = ~I don't remember her, but I remember the mines. A filthy place.~
@882  = ~I do not think so. I thought she was unruly, judgmental and a brute. But not yet mad and completely immune to reason.~
@883  = ~When we talked about Cloakwood mines, I had an impression that she did not care about the slaves, the bandits and Sarevok's war. All she wanted was to have the mines destroyed. No matter how.~
@884  = ~O, stop it. I already feel guilty about her madness.~
@885  = ~And wisdom is in letting things that you love be destroyed? In leaving your foes unchallenged?~
@886  = ~Kivan, are we still talking about Faldorn?~
@887  = ~No, of course not. But neither is it in making the whole world your enemies.~
@888  = ~Gods be good, Kivan! Next you will be asking me the meaning of life!~
@889  = ~It is because she preached a just cause.~
@890  = ~Killing everyone is a just cause?!~
@891  = ~It is not one's cause that makes one a martyr or a saint, it's the fervor.~
@892  = ~Those warrens were teaming with foul creatures, and the air within was poisoned by the suffering of the slaves.~
@893  = ~Don't. The ghosts of those that drowned there - both slaves and their masters - still haunt me.~

@895  = ~If I knew then what I know now, after Irenicus' handiwork, I would have never let them pull that plug. Davaeorn's cronies were not innocent, but still it was a horrible cruelty to let them drown.~
@896  = ~I hope that it was the right thing to do - not to flood the mines. I hope that now they are worked in a more humane way. Could even be that dwarves returned... Flooding the mines was such a stupid suggestion!~
@897  = ~So they were, indeed.~
@898  = ~Why?~
@899  = ~I saw right away that she was a troubled kid, and those Shadow Druids were nothing but a bad influence. I should have taken her out of there.~
@900  = ~There was something unsettling about Faldorn. It made me feel unpleasant, so I chose to turn away and ignore her instead of reaching out to her.~
@901  = ~It's just that I think that nobody in the whole world ever loved Faldorn. Her tribe gave her to the Shadow Druids when she was a babe, the Druids did not seem to hesitate to send her alone out in the world for a coming of age quest, now I, her former ally, had turned against her.~
@902  = ~Dunno, just wish that we did not have to kill her. She fought bravely in the mines.~
@903  = ~Faldorn was a creature of the woods, and barbarian-born. I think that she simply did not know another way to express her fear and her pain.~
@904  = ~Fear and pain? What would one like her be afraid of?~

@906  = ~It does not matter whom we are talking about.~

@1039 = ~The arrows Captain Arat gave us are of a good stock, but I always like to have my own, if I have time to make a quiver full. It is how I was taught: to 'evermore hit the mark' ...~
@1040 = ~I would rather you got some sleep, Kivan. You look so drawn...~
@1041 = ~Why don't you rest instead, Kivan? We have plenty of arrows.~
@1042 = ~Good idea, my friend. Can I be of any assistance?~
@1043 = ~(Nod briskly and head for your bedroll.)~
@1044 = ~What was that about 'evermore hit the mark'? It sounds like a litany.~
@1045 = ~Grief chases sleep away from my mind, gentle <CHARNAME>. It is better that I stay occupied.~
@1046 = ~I am not sleepy, either. Can I be of some help?~
@1047 = ~What use are the arrows, if the archer cannot shoot straight for his weariness? Go rest.~
@1048 = ~Yes. So I have been looking at my 'instruments' and found that I lacked decent shafts. As I am restless, I decided to correct that shortfall.~
@1049 = ~As am I. Perhaps I can be of assistance?~
@1050 = ~They are all of a rough make, <CHARNAME>, produced by the hundreds. They will serve, but I am restless, and would like to make something of better quality.~
@1051 = ~Of course. Do you know how to fletch arrows?~
@1052 = ~Yes, don't worry. Now, less talk, more work!~
@1053 = ~Erik taught me some in Candlekeep, but if you could show me how you prefer it done, that would be great.~
@1054 = ~No, I have never done it before. Would you mind teaching me?~
@1055 = ~There is truth in your words. I will sleep.~
@1056 = ~Indeed. You are doing perfectly well.~
@1057 = ~Of course.~
@1058 = ~Here are the feathers. I like to cut them into more rounded outlines than a simple wedge - like this. Would that I had feathers of any color other than white, I would have made a cock feather. But we will do all three with the same color.~
@1059 = ~Now coat the shaft with the glue, glue the feathers together and then tie them onto the arrow, using strong thread and whipping them front and back, like that. Coat the thread with wax: it seals the thread so it does not stretch or move. And this way the thread wrapping puts pressure on the fletchings and holds them into place.~
@1060 = ~And that is it. Are you ready to start?~
@1061 = ~Err... I think I'd pass. I'll leave you to your work, Kivan.~
@1062 = ~Very much like Erik taught me. Now less talk, more work!~
@1063 = ~Yes, of course. So I cut the feathers... like this?~
@1064 = ~First things first: the arrows are made from light straight wood such as aspen or poplar. If you are lucky to find an ash straight enough, it is good for arrows as well, owing to its greater weight: it will strike the target harder. Alder, birch, elder, willow and the heavier hornbeam are also suitable.~
@1065 = ~ Here are the rods, I have cut them and coated with linseed oil to hide the imperfections of the wood and to seal and harden. Then I put a sliver of horn, so that the arrow will not split when shot, into the end of each shaft parallel to the grain. Next I cut the knocks - these parallel-sided slots at a right angle to the grain and approximately as long as the width of the arrow.~
@1066 = ~Now the feathers - those are cut from the pinion feathers of a goose. I like to cut them into more rounded outlines than a simple wedge - like this. I do not have feathers of any color other than white, so I cannot make a cock feather  - all three will be of the same color. It is unfortunate, since the cock feather helps to knock right.~
@1067 = ~Now coat the shaft with the glue, glue the feathers together and then tie them onto the arrow, using strong thread and whipping them front and back, like that. Now see this blue green wax in the kettle? Coat the thread with wax: it seals the thread so it does not stretch or move. And this way the thread wrapping puts pressure on the fletchings and holds them into place.~
@1068 = ~You do know a lot about your craft, Kivan. I am dazzled.~
@1069 = ~It is quite simply a passage from an old book to help one learn archery properly. Have you never heard of it?~
@1070 = ~ What is the chief point in shooting that every man laboureth to come to? To hit the mark.~
@1071 = ~O, that old thing. I knew it sounded familiar!~
@1072 = ~So, how many things are required to make a man evermore hit the mark?~
@1073 = ~I'll leave you to your work, Kivan.~
@1074 = ~So you are going to fletch arrows. Can I be of any assistance?~
@1075 = ~Two, shooting straight and keeping of length.~
@1076 = ~How should a man shoot straight, and how should a man keep a length?~
@1077 = ~Ah, you know your craft well. I'll leave you to your work, Kivan.~
@1078 = ~In knowing and having things belonging to shooting; and when they be known and had, in well handling of them; whereof some belong to shooting straight, some to keeping of a length, some commonly to them both, as shall be told severally of them in place convenient.~
@1079 = ~Things belonging to shooting, what be they?~
@1080 = ~All things be outward; and some be instruments for every sere archer to bring with him, proper for his own use: others be general to every man, as the place and time serveth.~
@1081 = ~Which be instruments?~
@1082 = ~Bracer, shooting glove, string, bow, and shaft.~
@1083 = ~Which be general to all men?~
@1084 = ~Shafts meaning arrows of course. And you are going to make some... Can I be of any assistance?~
@1085 = ~The weather and the mark; yet the mark is ever under the rule of the weather.~
@1086 = ~Now you know as much as I do. (smile) It is time for me to attend to the shafts.~
@1087 = ~Yes, this is so. Now if you only - (Kivan's deft hands spring into action, guiding yours. Together, you make enough, and Kivan stacks them in a cloth bag he wears on his belt. He looks at you in surprise when you ask him why he does not have a back quiver.)~
@1088 = ~I am an archer, <CHARNAME>, not a N'Tel'Quess lord posing in front of the ladies. It is the only use I can see for it.~
@1089 = ~I am sorry. I must have talked for a long time... Let us go more slowly: if you only - (Kivan's deft hands sprang into action, guiding yours. Together, you make enough, and Kivan stacks them in a cloth bag he wears on his belt. He looks at you in surprise when you ask him why he does not have a back quiver)~
@1090 = ~How strange: someone made a portrait of a monster, however crude.~
@1091 = ~A monster's portrait? Why not?~
@1092 = ~Strange indeed...~
@1093 = ~Would you have preferred a pretty nude?~
@1094 = ~I don't think it is a portrait of an individual creature, Kivan. Just a generic drawing.~
@1095 = ~I suppose. I was just thinking that I know of a better model.~
@1096 = ~Deheriana, no doubt?~
@1097 = ~As do I. But I'd not commission whoever drew this to make my portrait. The quality is awful.~
@1098 = ~Hells, Kivan, let's think of how to get out of here alive, not some stupid pictures!~
@1099 = ~I wish I had Deheriana's fair likeness.~
@1100 = ~What, your reveries are not enough to drool over?~
@1101 = ~I am decent with pastels. Perhaps if you can tell me what she looked like I can do a few sketches for you when we stop for the night..~
@1102 = ~What did Deheriana look like, Kivan?~
@1103 = ~You mean you do not have one? I imagined you as the sort to wear a medallion with a lock of hair and a miniature.~
@1104 = ~Alas, drawing portraits is one talent that our kin does not possess.~
@1105 = ~You forget that Tel'Quess do not attach the same titillating prohibition on walking bare as N'Tel'Quess do. I just wished that I had Deheriana's fair likeness.~
@1106 = ~I am decent with pastels. Perhaps if you can tell me what she looked like I can do a few sketches for you when we stop for the night.~
@1107 = ~You are right. It must be a challenging task to capture an essence of a living creature on a piece of a stretched canvas.~
@1108 = ~Yes, probably.~
@1109 = ~It's not that hard. I am actually quite decent with pastels.~
@1110 = ~You look wistful, Kivan.~
@1111 = ~Right away, My <PRO_LADYLORD>!~
@1112 = ~Go to the crows!~
@1113 = ~That would be an unexpected boon. I will try my best.~
@1114 = ~Deheriana... Deheriana means "A lady of high wisdom," or "Lady from the South" in Quenya, depending on which dialect you are speaking. She is swift as a lark to anger and to forgive, and she laughs easily. She possesses a special sort of kindness, that of a healer: it knows no bounds, but it is honest.~
@1115 = ~(cough) Now I remember why elven artists make bad portraitists: they try to capture the inner elf and forget about the physical form.~
@1116 = ~Kivan, what I need is what she looked like, not what she was like.~
@1117 = ~Deheriana is long dead, elf. Use the past tense.~
@1118 = ~That is very helpful, but I will also need more, err...visual details. Was her face long and narrow? Were her cheekbones high? What color were her eyes, her hair? Things of that nature.~
@1119 = ~I am sorry, Kivan, but I cannot do that: I feel like I am buying wine for a hopeless drunkard.~
@1120 = ~Deheriana... Deheriana means "A lady of high wisdom," or "Lady from the South" in Quenya. She is swift as a lark to anger and to forgive, and she laughs easily. She possesses a special sort of kindness, that of a healer: it knows no bounds, but it is honest.~
@1121 = ~Kivan, I asked what she looked like, not what she was like...~
@1122 = ~How about some err... visual details? Was her face long and narrow? Were her cheekbones high? What color were her eyes, her hair? Things of that nature.~
@1123 = ~There is one art, <CHARNAME>, that our kin did not master: drawing portraits.~
@1124 = ~Uhm... why not?~
@1125 = ~A pity, that. But we have chatted long enough.~
@1126 = ~The elves, <CHARNAME>, did not master the art of drawing portraits.~
@1127 = ~Alas. She is beautiful, my Deheriana.~
@1128 = ~She is swift as a lark to anger and to forgive, and she laughs easily. She possesses a special sort of kindness, that of a healer: it knows no bounds, but it is honest.~
@1129 = ~I know it sounds human, but what did she look like, err...visually?~
@1130 = ~Very beautiful, indeed.~
@1131 = ~You can do that?~
@1132 = ~A person's individuality is contained within: There is much more similarity in our appearances than between our spirits.~
@1133 = ~But if I shut myself off from the Spirit and looked at Deheriana only with my eyes and not my heart, I would have seen a tall elf. Her eyes are green, like oak leaves, her hair - rich brown - is braided and set with crystal bells. She is slender, and her skin, the silvery hue of her Moon elven ancestors...~
@1134 = ~(smile) I will see what I can conjure for you...~
@1135 = ~Kivan, I just came to realize that no drawing would ever capture the image you are seeing in your mind.~
@1136 = ~This is the very reason why elven artists cannot draw portraits: they try too hard to capture the inner elf.~
@1137 = ~Her eyes are green, like oak leaves, her hair - rich brown - is braided and set with crystal bells. She is slender, and her skin, the silvery hue of her Moon elven ancestors.~

@1144 = ~Do not be embarrassed, it is not your fault that you grew away from Tel'Quess. Our artists try to capture the inner elf, so reproducing the physical likeness is difficult for them.~
@1145 = ~You speak truly, my friend. Can one draw love?~
@1146 = ~Do you need anything, <CHARNAME>? Are you hungry? Hurting?~
@1147 = ~No, no. I am fine. Go rest.~
@1148 = ~What brings on the concern that I hear in your voice, Kivan?~
@1149 = ~Kivan, stop fussing over me. I am soulless, not sick.~
@1150 = ~Yes, I am hurting.~
@1151 = ~I am hungry.~
@1152 = ~Could you just talk with me for a while? I am frightened of falling asleep lately.~
@1153 = ~I just wanted to make sure that you are well. Wake me up if you...~
@1154 = ~Don't worry, if I turn into the Slayer again, I'm likely to wake even Khalid and Dynaheir, let alone our bunch of light sleepers.~
@1155 = ~I most definitely would. Go...and thank you.~
@1156 = ~This beast, Irenicus, left you soulless. I think that you are in pain, so I tried to put a curative spell on you... but I have not felt the usual sensation of mending flesh and spirit. Just an emptiness of sorts.~
@1157 = ~Do not worry, I am not in pain. Go rest.~
@1158 = ~(shudder) Please, Kivan, do not say such things. You are making it worse!~
@1159 = ~I don't understand. My wounds heal well enough.~
@1160 = ~Well, it is fairly obvious that you cannot help me to become any less soulless.~
@1161 = ~I've been missing my soul, 
Since the day before last 
Wait a moment, good sir,
Have you seen it, perchance?~
@1162 = ~Your face is hollowed, and the way you glance about sometimes... I thought that you were in pain, so I tried to put a curative spell on you. But I have not felt the usual sensation of mending flesh and spirit. Just an emptiness of sorts.~
@1163 = ~I've been missing my soul,
Since the day before last 
Wait a moment, good sir,
Have you seen it, perchance?~
@1164 = ~I have already tried to put a curative spell on you, but I have not felt the usual sensation of mending flesh and spirit. Just an emptiness of sorts.~
@1165 = ~I can, however, make you more comfortable. (Kivan brings a couple of extra blankets and starts arranging them to your satisfaction.)~
@1166 = ~I don't understand. My wounds heal well enough...~
@1167 = ~(It is oddly pleasant to have this grave man cloaking your shoulders. As he kneels over you, you roll to one side slightly so that your head comes to rest on his lap.)~
@1168 = ~Let me see if I can find something edible in the saddlebags.~
@1169 = ~Thank you.~
@1170 = ~No, Kivan, you do not understand. I hunger, but not for food. I hunger for battles, for killing. Every time I close my eyes, I see people and monsters falling to my wrath like wheat under a farmer's sickle.~
@1171 = ~No, don't go. Could you just talk with me for a while?~
@1172 = ~That is an ill jest, <CHARNAME>. Waking the dead is a foul thing to do, and Bhaal's avatar invading you is even fouler.~
@1173 = ~I am sorry, Kivan. Do not worry; I will not let the beast in. Go rest.~
@1174 = ~Sorry, but death and the dead are all I can think about. I hunger for battles, for killing. Every time I close my eyes I see people and monsters falling to my wrath like wheat under a farmer's sickle.~
@1175 = ~It was a horrible joke, not even funny, but... don't go. Could you just talk with me for a while?~
@1176 = ~Good night, and may your rest be peaceful. (Before leaving you to your rest, Kivan makes a sign of protection from evil over you.)~
@1177 = ~It reminds me of the times when I was young and my thoughts kept me awake, I would slip away from my parents' house and go visit my great-great aunt.~
@1178 = ~It sound like the beginning of one of Jan's stories. Does it have griffons in it?~
@1179 = ~Actually, Kivan, can we just sit in a companionable silence?~
@1180 = ~Yes, I doubt that you were short of soul, though...~
@1181 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Deheriana would have known what to say...I loathe being helpless.~
@1182 = ~Try to rest. I foresee that it will be some time before we have the luxury of being left in peace even for a short time again.~
@1183 = ~I do not pretend to understand this myself, <CHARNAME>.~
@1184 = ~Perhaps it is different for each person who can heal, but I always feel that the word of prayer restores a person's soul, as well as body. The strength to become whole and to live again comes from soul to soul, from the healer to the healed.~
@1185 = ~Your flesh closes around your wounds, for which we must be grateful, but your soul... I do not feel it growing better. There is only a void.~
@1186 = ~I am afraid that Irenicus is right: you are withering under the strain of unhealed inner pain.~
@1187 = ~I... I am sorry. This is not a particularly calming bedside talk .~
@1188 = ~I'd better go.~
@1189 = ~If you go, you would leave me pondering on my swiftly approaching death. Could we talk about something else for a while?~
@1190 = ~Actually, Kivan, can we just sit in companionable silence? Your presence is reassuring.~
@1191 = ~Yes, you do that. You are just making things worse!~
@1192 = ~ Go, then. And, Kivan? Thank you for trying.~
@1193 = ~True, and I loathe being helpless. But I will fight those who've stolen your soul from you.~
@1194 = ~That is an old love tune, is it not?~
@1195 = ~Yes. There is something eerie in its appropriateness to my situation.~
@1196 = ~It should look slightly odd
It should bear the marks 
Of the painful sort
Have you seen it, perchance?~
@1197 = ~Old? It's no older than the yesterday's morning dawn. I made a habit long ago of outfitting my miseries with rhymes and rhythms. It makes the burden of misfortunes lighter when they are shared with others.~
@1198 = ~I do not know. It just came to me in a flash...perhaps I have heard it before.~
@1199 = ~(Kivan strokes your hair lightly.)~
@1200 = ~(Much as you want it to last, you are afraid that Kivan should hear the loud and fast beating of your heart.) G...good night.~
@1201 = ~Kiss me. We both know that you want to!~
@1202 = ~(You say nothing and eventually drift away into sleep, your last conscious memory being the caress of Kivan's warm fingers.)~
@1203 = ~(Kivan shakes his head, his expression grim.)~
@1204 = ~(A rueful smile breaks out on Kivan's granite face.) You are right. I hope that it will not be as long-winded and as pointless as the impossible gnome's concoctions.~
@1205 = ~I called Gil'Alana my great aunt, but in truth I do not know our exact relation. She had wisdom of an elder, but remained an extravagant woman. What attracted me most was that she was one of the few Shilmista folk who traveled far from home.~
@1206 = ~Her tree house was chaos of strange artifacts, herbs, animals and scrolls. I used to pick one at random and there was always a story attached to each.~
@1207 = ~Interesting... but I would hate to keep you longer from your sleep. Good night, Kivan, and thank you.~
@1208 = ~What was your favorite one?~
@1209 = ~(Kivan nods and settles himself comfortably. He produces needle with a thread and starts mending a tear in his well-worn cloak.)~
@1210 = ~(He is natural at companionable silence.)~
@1211 = ~Elves do not have souls, <CHARNAME>. We have spirits.  But I would not wish such a fate on anyone.~
@1212 = ~I doubt that whoever wrote this song pondered on what it means to miss one's soul. To compare it to falling in love is most definitely wrong.~
@1213 = ~It is a sick suggestion that you could love a man who ripped away your soul.~
@1214 = ~(Smile cryptically. You do not think it to be out of the realm of possibility. However horrific, your tormentor was an enigmatic man. There was a certain something about him.)~
@1215 = ~Actually, it is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. However horrific, my tormentor was an enigmatic man. There was a certain something about him...~
@1216 = ~The man who has stolen the woman's soul does not have to be the same man who holds it in trust. Does he?~
@1217 = ~(Chuckle. Perhaps it is for the best that your soul is not yours to give. You would have left it at the very bottom of those black tilted eyes.)~
@1218 = ~A haunting melody. (He shakes his head sharply as if chasing the tune away.) ~
@1219 = ~It chills me to the bone that you have compared your terrifying ordeal to falling in love. Has fate been so cruel to you that you'd love a man who ripped away your soul?~
@1220 = ~The man who has stolen the woman's soul does not have to be the same man who holds it in trust. Does he??~
@1221 = ~I was never lucky in love. At least Irenicus was interested in my soul.~
@1222 = ~(Kivan gives you a quick peck on your cheek. It would be an exaggeration to call it brotherly. Then he rises to his feet in one smooth motion.)~
@1223 = ~There was this bracelet...~
@1224 = ~Our patrols returned with the news that a human was seeking entry to Shilmista. If he was not given King's Galladel's leave, he would wait for Gil'Alana on the borders for a fortnight. To remove the burden of decision from His Grace, my aunt immediately went to meet the human.~
@1225 = ~Adventuring in her youth, Gil'Alana had been loved by a human adventurer - the youngest son of a noble family, she called Ermine. Without prospects and care, the man was daredevil, which suited my great aunt just fine. But the human's life is short and full of uncertainties. Bandits had attacked my great-aunt's small company, and by their accent, Ermine had concluded that they had come from his lands. Inconveniently dead, the band could not be questioned, but Ermine got it into his head that they were bounty hunters, sent to settle old accounts.~
@1226 = ~The hot-headed man immediately turned the horse northwards to face his imagined nemesis in person. My aunt followed.~
@1227 = ~As they came to Ermine's ancestral hold, it became clear that Ermine was the heir apparent and that it was someone in the family who wanted him dead. Gil'Alana pleaded with the man to refuse his inheritance, but the stubborn man took it, changing from a carefree outlaw into an iron-fisted lord of the castle almost overnight, with the frightening rapidity of a human.~
@1228 = ~He wed of course, for political reasons. On the night of his wedding he gave Gil'Alana this bracelet. He managed to fascinate her and keep her love for a few more years before she left him to his wife, his castle and his human concerns.~
@1229 = ~Another few years passed, and my aunt was confronted by a noblewoman who called her a whore and a thief, demanding that she return the heirloom which by rights belonged to Ermine's trueborn son.~
@1230 = ~I could almost imagine my great-aunt staring coldly at the widow and letting the bracelet drop to her feet. 'I loved the man for himself, not for his...trinkets,' was all she said.~
@1231 = ~The knight who came was Ermine's descendent. Unlike his ancestor he had chosen a road of order and honor. The old story troubled him, for he could not make out the right party from the wrong. But he knew one thing for sure: The bracelet was Gil'Alana's by his ancestor's wish, and should be restored to her. For he, of all his kin, saw the cleverly worked magical wards spelling 'Gil'Alana, melamin'-Gil'Alana, my love. So he came all the way to Shilmista to right the wrong of my aunt accused of being a thief a good four centuries before, and to return the token.~
@1232 = ~(thoughtfully) Humans are strange creatures, ever torn between pettiness and greatness.~
@1233 = ~(Kivan's eyes widen. If you intended to horrify him, your attempts met with success.)~
@1234 = ~Let us hope that we would soon win your soul for you to keep.~
@1235 = ~(Kivan's eyes meet yours and for a moment he watches you, a look akin to that of a man who had just awoken on his angular features.)~
@1236 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... (cough)~
@1237 = ~<CHARNAME>, it is obvious that you are tired and upset and my conversation does not make it any better.~
@1238 = ~(Magical rope or not, the climb down the endless shaft was no easy feat. Kivan is the last to descend. His movements are effortless, but his face is tense. Yet, he seems to be determined to say not a word.)~
@1239 = ~(Leave him be.)~
@1240 = ~Why the sour face?~
@1241 = ~You look ready to chew through stone walls, Kivan.~
@1242 = ~Kivan, I appreciate you coming along. I know how much you hate to be underground.~
@1243 = ~So do I. But, <CHARNAME>, it seems to me that we travel to more and more accursed places every time.~
@1244 = ~Psychotic? Need I remind you that the gathering of the most esteemed specialists in the field pronounced all of us sane but a few days ago.~
@1245 = ~I am agile enough to do that, yes. But not craven enough.~
@1246 = ~Nothing. And that is why I climbed down to... here.~
@1247 = ~No.~
@1248 = ~I will descend into the Demonweb Pits if needed to help you regain your soul, mellonamin. Now, let's move before the rocks come crashing down on our heads.~
@1249 = ~Do I? Good. We might need it to get out of this place.~
@1250 = ~Are you afraid of the dark?~
@1251 = ~I have every confidence that we will find another way.~
@1252 = ~You are but an elf, Kivan, granted a dangerous and psychotic one, but still... don't hoard unrealistic expectations.~
@1253 = ~I was climbing down for what seemed like hours when my every instinct told me to climb up.~
@1254 = ~I felt the same, Kivan. But what could a <PRO_MANWOMAN> do?~
@1255 = ~You still can, you know. You are agile enough.~
@1256 = ~It is the full measure of your captor's vileness that he came this way and that he would treat with the drow. (Kivan looks around in disgust.) A foul place.~
@1257 = ~I rather like it, actually. I wouldn't mind purchasing a vacation stalactite somewhere on the outskirts of Ust Natha.~
@1258 = ~I have no liking for this place either, but for the sake of our quest, please be quiet!~
@1259 = ~The caves do not scare me like they do you, Mr. 'Must we be crawling through this dwarven warren?'.~
@1260 = ~I would not have minded the caves so much if not for drow. They are unpleasant to say the least.~
@1261 = ~It must be difficult for a person of your faith to walk the streets of Ust Natha.~
@1262 = ~You will have wonderful neighbors, <CHARNAME>. The most vicious and merciless killers, deceitful and despicably evil.~
@1263 = ~(Keeping your face straight.) Come on, svirfneblin are not *that* bad.~
@1264 = ~Yes, the drow are unpleasant to say the least.~
@1265 = ~Why do you elves hate drow so?~
@1266 = ~Yes, my Captain. I have spoken out of turn. Please give me to the priestesses of Lolth, so they can teach me humility.~
@1267 = ~Now, that's an idea! I swear to the gods I will too, if you don't shut up!~
@1268 = ~(Scowl.)~
@1269 = ~Oh, Kivan, please do not bring doom upon all of us.~
@1270 = ~Yes, Ilharess. I have spoken out of turn. Please give me to the priestesses of Lolth, so they can teach me humility.~
@1271 = ~Ilharess, huh.~
@1272 = ~Oh, Kivan, please, do not bring doom upon all of us.~
@1273 = ~Oh, Kivan, I know that you are grieving, but please, do not bring doom upon all of us.~
@1274 = ~I have no love for the lightless and stifling dungeons deep under ground, but no fear of them either, my sharp-tongued friend.~
@1275 = ~This place is the worst of them all, since we have to deal with its dwellers: the most vicious and merciless killers, deceitful and despicably evil.~
@1276 = ~They are creatures of darkness and must be destroyed for the world to become a better place.~
@1277 = ~(shrug) I do not believe that drow are all inherently evil. I mean, Drizzt Do'Urden... -~
@1278 = ~You sound as vicious as any drow yourself, Kivan.~
@1279 = ~Agreed, but for now we must pretend to be of their ilk. Please, do not bring doom upon all of us.~
@1280 = ~You do not have to destroy the drow, Kivan. Just their society built on hatred, deceit and worship of Lolth.~
@1281 = ~It is. Every step of the way I see cruelty, and I cannot put a stop to it; I witness injustice, and I must remain silent.~
@1282 = ~Shevarash's pain and my own outrage fill my heart to bursting, yet all I can do is to ball my fists and grit my teeth.~
@1283 = ~We will be away from here soon, Kivan. For now, please do not bring doom upon all of us.~
@1284 = ~You must hate drow even more now than before...~
@1285 = ~I am sorry that you must suffer through this, but there is no other choice. The drow are too many for us to force our way through.~
@1286 = ~(Kivan smiles despite himself.)~
@1287 = ~You know that I spoke about the drow, <CHARNAME>.~
@1288 = ~Would you have me to tell you of five thousand years of war in few words?~
@1289 = ~Drow were once called Ilythiiri - the Elves of the South - and they were the mightiest among all elvenkind.~
@1290 = ~But Lolth and Ghaundaur corrupted their hearts. Their nobility and priests were never satisfied with what they had. So they raided and pillaged all of their neighbors. In the end the alliance was formed against the Illythiiri, and they were defeated by the combined forces of the elves, humans and dwarves. They fled under the earth and dwelled there for ten generations, full of hatred, venturing out only to raid and kill.~
@1291 = ~They know no mercy or kindness.~
@1292 = ~Seems to me that they are trying to avenge themselves. I thought that you of all people would understand...~
@1293 = ~Elves sure have good memories! Thousands of years and you still fight each other! Worse than Thay and Rashemen!~
@1294 = ~I see. (Look around wearily.) Let us go now. I do not like calling attention to ourselves. And, Kivan? Please, do not let this ancient mess doom all of us.~
@1295 = ~I understand the need for secrecy, but let us go about our business quickly. Drow are very good at being suspicious and distrustful. It will not be long before one of us will displease them in word or deed. This disguise will not help us then: drow will torture and kill one of their own as readily as an outsider.~
@1296 = ~I am sorry. I keep forgetting that you have things to live for.~
@1297 = ~I...there is anger within me; it is as if I cannot forgive the world for going on without her.~
@1298 = ~(Look at Kivan, not quite knowing what to say.)~
@1299 = ~My poor friend. Being among your sworn enemies does not help you forget your grief, does it?~
@1300 = ~Poor Kivan. If I hug you, would it look suspicious to the drow?~
@1301 = ~Drizzt Do'Urden is one in twenty thousand of the drow that populate Menzoberranzzan.~
@1302 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, there are drow of non-evil disposition, and even cities free of the Spider Queen's poison.~
@1303 = ~But Ust Natha is not one of them!~
@1304 = ~Yes, you are right...though it's sort of fun to pretend to be a drow for a while.~
@1305 = ~Has not being literally in drow skin taught you anything?! They are more victims than monsters.~
@1306 = ~Non-evil drow cities? Which ones?~
@1307 = ~I sound like a drow to you?~
@1308 = ~Do not you know what the drow are? They were ever the warlike and decadent folk, even when they lived on the surface, in the jungles of the South and were called Illythiri. They were the mightiest of elvenkind then, but their nobility and priests were never satisfied with what they had.~
@1309 = ~So they raided and pillaged all of their neighbors, even the other elven tribes, killing their own kin. In the end the alliance was formed against the Illythiiri, and the combined forces of the elves, humans and dwarves defeated them. They fled under the earth and continued their wars even there; turning against the dwarves, against each other. Their vicious battles caused the collapse of the great dwarven cave Bhaerynden, and created the Great Rift on the surface.~
@1310 = ~When they finally settled, the drow formed many rival cities and dwelled in strife with the whole world for ten generations, full of hatred, venturing out only to raid and kill.~
@1311 = ~They build the society that suits their self-interested and evil nature, <CHARNAME>.~
@1312 = ~ They were ever the warlike and decadent folk, even when they lived on the surface, in the jungles of the South and were called Illythiri. They were the mightiest of elvenkind then, but their nobility and priests were never satisfied with what they had.~

They fled under the earth and continued their wars even there, turning against the dwarves, against each other. Their vicious battles caused the collapse of the great dwarven cave Bhaerynden, and created the Great Rift on the surface.~
@1314 = ~I wish that I could!~
@1315 = ~What did drow do to you that you hate them so?~
@1316 = ~No, Kivan, please... please, do not let this ancient mess doom all of us.~
@1317 = ~You are equating me with drow! I do not wish to speak with you any longer, <CHARNAME>.~
@1318 = ~Elves did not start this war. Neither did they try to conquer the drow in the Underdark.~
@1319 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, they will find it suspicious. Drow only know raw passion, bordering on hatred. They do not understand any other sort of love.~
@1320 = ~But your expression of friendship warms my heart.~
@1321 = ~These are illusions, dangerous illusions, <CHARNAME>~
@1322 = ~The drow built this society and lived by its constraints for ten generations since the Crown Wars.~
@1323 = ~It is not about to change because you have come here. Do not misunderstand me: I have lost count of your great deeds, but revolutionizing the Underdark is beyond you.~
@1324 = ~And until that happens, the only thing a man can do in the Underdark is to keep the drow a sword's length away.~
@1325 = ~That is enough: I do not want us to be overheard speaking of such things. The monks that raised you must have taught you how to find a scroll in a library. If we ever return to the starlit world, you can read all you want about the drowkind.~
@1326 = ~And yet another one of my guild falls. Let Merella find her way to Mielikki's or Shaundakul's side.~
@1327 = ~I join your prayer, kinsman.~
@1328 = ~We did not know Merella in life, but she was one of us in word and deed.~
@1329 = ~Yes. Rest in peace, Merella. Now, Kivan, let us march on.~
@1330 = ~Your guild? I thought only thieves had guilds.~
@1331 = ~Did you know her?~
@1332 = ~Our skills and inclinations both lead to a solitary existence in the woods. But since I joined your company, I have come to understand how rewarding a friendship and traveling with another woodsman can be.~
@1333 = ~Yes, with Minsc, Valygar and you, I feel that we have a great company.~
@1334 = ~It is good indeed to know that there is someone I can rely upon to know the ways of the wilderness and who will do what is needed without being told.~
@1335 = ~It is not just our skills as foresters that unite us, Kivan.~
@1336 = ~(nod) It's true.~
@1337 = ~I was speaking figuratively, <CHARNAME>. A ranger's skills and inclinations both lead to a solitary existence in the woods.~
@1338 = ~What does it mean to you to be a ranger, Kivan?~
@1339 = ~Fascinating.~
@1340 = ~Don't you grow lonely? It must be difficult to be without friends and family.~
@1341 = ~You had Deheriana with you, did not you?~
@1342 = ~No, mellonamin. A ranger's skills and inclinations both lead to a solitary existence in the woods, but I feel kinship nonetheless.~
@1343 = ~Were you a ranger-protector yourself?~
@1344 = ~(Kivan nods.)~
@1345 = ~There is more than just your competence that I enjoy. It is the kindred spirit, the love of the wilderness, the readiness to help a stranded traveler, no matter whether he is lost in the woods or in his own destiny.~
@1346 = ~Say, Kivan, for you, what does it mean to be a ranger?~
@1347 = ~That's true, of course.~
@1348 = ~Were you a ranger-protector once?~
@1349 = ~Yes, of course. It is the kindred spirit, the love of the wilderness, the readiness to help a stranded traveler no matter if he is lost in the woods or in his own destiny.~
@1350 = ~Actually, I meant that we kick ass, but that other stuff you mentioned is great, too!~
@1351 = ~(Nods)~
@1352 = ~It has always been my instinct to guard the forest and my kin against foulness. This I still hold the most important thing of all. Should I fail in it, I would be but a mercenary who lets money chose his fights.~
@1353 = ~As for the rest, when I was young, it was Shilmista and the Snowflakes that I loved, especially after the war.~
@1354 = ~But so much I lost, and so much I saw - in your brave company and on my own - that I cannot restrict myself to one land, even the fairest among them all.~
@1355 = ~Shaundakul calls me, stirring me to travel on and find the lands yet unknown, but marvelous. And this, to me, is part of being a ranger.~
@1356 = ~(Kivan clasps your hand in a universal sign of camaraderie.)~
@1357 = ~Yes, I was. I have guarded a small elven village in Shilmista from whatever evil might come forth from the deep crevices in the Snowflake Mountains.~
@1358 = ~In my youth I loved it, but so much I lost, and so much I saw - in your brave company and on my own - that I cannot restrict myself to one land, even the fairest among them all.~
@1359 = ~(Kivan claps you on your shoulder and laughs.) As long as it is for goodness, mellonamin, as long as it is for goodness!~
@1360 = ~(Laugh along merrily.) Life is good!~
@1361 = ~Ah, well, it's good to hear you laughing. Jokes aside though, what does it mean to be a ranger for you, Kivan?~
@1362 = ~What about yourself? What does it mean for you to be a ranger?~
@1363 = ~I'm of the same mind as Merella was - I'd like to find people who need me and live keeping an eye on them, but sort of at a distance.~
@1364 = ~What you've said rings true to me. I want to travel, helping strangers in the hour of need... It would be good.~
@1365 = ~I have not discovered it yet.~
@1366 = ~May you find a beautiful forest and good folk, then.~
@1367 = ~Then let the song of the twelve winds be your guiding, kins<PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1368 = ~A wise answer. Mayhap no one knows for sure till the end of one's days.~
@1369 = ~We are deep into the elven lands now, <CHARNAME>. Can you feel it?~
@1370 = ~Yes. I breathe easier here...~
@1371 = ~Kivan, if we don't move on, these are going to be drow lands very shortly.~
@1372 = ~We are in the Forest of Tethir, I think.~
@1373 = ~(nods) So do I. We are in the great Forest of Tethir, <CHARNAME>.~
@1374 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, this land will wither before accepting drow rule.  We are in the great Forest of Tethir.~
@1375 = ~The Forest of Tethir... every tree here whispers of Cormanthyr and of mighty Tethir himself.~
@1376 = ~Cormanthyr?~
@1377 = ~Tethir?~
@1378 = ~Yes, I hear it, too.~
@1379 = ~Uh-huh.~
@1380 = ~The ancient elven empire, <CHARNAME>, that once spanned from the Sword Coast to the Galenas. It was one forest then, good and beautiful.~
@1381 = ~But let us go now. The defenders of Suldanessellar might need our aid.~
@1382 = ~Tethir, also called the Dragonslayer, is an elven hero of old. He was the first among the elves to slay an ancient red wyrm.~
@1383 = ~But let us go now. The defenders of Suldanessellar might need our aid, even if we are less famed than the heroes of old.~
@1384 = ~A marvel...~
@1385 = ~But let us go now. The defenders of this fabled land might need our aid.~
@1386 = ~<CHARNAME>? You look thoughtful. Is something amiss?~
@1387 = ~No... no. I was just... thinking.~
@1388 = ~I saw him... I saw Irenicus in my dreams, Kivan.~
@1389 = ~Ye gods, can't you mind your own business?~
@1390 = ~Very well, then, just do not make a habit out of it.~
@1391 = ~Sorry, sorry, that was a bad jest. But you do look disturbed.~
@1392 = ~Very well. I saw him... I saw Irenicus in my dreams, Kivan.~
@1393 = ~That can only bear ill.~
@1394 = ~It did. I saw him killing elves on some sort of a huge tree trunk.~
@1395 = ~Perhaps, but there was also a hot chick along. That sort of reduced the tension.~
@1396 = ~I will leave you to your brooding then.~
@1397 = ~A painful vision. Was that a nightmare, or did it feel like your past dreams, that were not dreams?~
@1398 = ~I think it was the true dreaming, yes. We have to hurry to Suldanessellar's aid, Kivan. We have to, or there will be none left to save.~
@1399 = ~Who cares! There was a hot chick along. Very neat. Yeah, she was crooning about saviors and all that, but I was not listening too closely.~
@1400 = ~I don't know, Kivan. But does it matter? Our tasks are laid before us.~
@1401 = ~Ah, so you were daydreaming. All well and good for a young man like you.~
@1402 = ~Then let us march!~
@1403 = ~True. But let us hurry. Your dreams, they ever were a foreboding of the things to come...~
@1404 = ~Always.~
@1405 = ~For there are those who love.~
@1406 = ~For there are those who love, and only the greatest fool would prefer solitude to love.~
@1407 = ~Without the one you love, even a crowded city is a place of loneliness.~
@1408 = ~A ranger is not without friends, especially if he bonds himself to a particular settlement.~
@1409 = ~And then there are those who love.~
@1410 = ~Without the one you love, even the crowded city is a place of loneliness.~
@1411 = ~I don't know.  I suppose I will have to kill you, regardless... there doesn't seem to be any way out of this.~
@1412 = ~I need your piwafwi cloak to prove to Phaere that you are dead...~
@1413 = ~You can join with us, Solaufein... and leave this place.~
@1414 = ~Solaufein, if we are to imitate your death, perhaps it would be better if your piwafwi was bloodied and cut. (Kivan extends his dagger to Solaufein, hilt first.)~
@1415 = ~A single dagger cut to take the weapon master of House Despana down? You are selling me cheaper than a stone-hearted matron mother would.~
@1416 = ~(Kivan moves to sheathe the dagger; Solaufein snatches it away.)~
@1417 = ~(With a still face, Solaufen grabs tightly to the dagger and pulls it through his fist.)~
@1418 = ~(Kivan steadies the drow as he kneels over the cloak lowering his hand to increase the blood flow.)~
@1419 = ~That is enough. You are losing too much blood.~
@1420 = ~What are you afraid of? That I will become paler, more like a surfacer?~
@1421 = ~No, I am afraid that you will be too weak to flee and our deception should then be uncovered.~
@1422 = ~Could you heal him, Aerie?~
@1423 = ~Yes... yes, of course. (Aerie gently takes Solaufein's arm and whispers a spell.) You... you were hurt badly, weapon master...~
@1424 = ~Are you crying, female?~
@1425 = ~Aerie, step back. He has to leave now.~
@1426 = ~And I thought it was only our sweet Lady Lolth and her nurturing serfs who condemned a show of mercy. Are you one of them?~
@1427 = ~Do not dare call me that, drow!~
@1428 = ~Kivan, he... he is just joking.~
@1429 = ~Female, do not let them catch you and turn your heart to rock.~
@1430 = ~You need healing.~
@1431 = ~(With his hale hand Solaufein fishes out a potion bottle, un-stoppers it with his teeth and gulps down its contents.) Ah, the fighter's brew.~
@1432 = ~What... what will you do now, Solaufein?~
@1433 = ~But I have done my duty. There was a dream that came both in reverie and in sleep.~
@1434 = ~One needs only a look into the eyes of the slaves.~
@1435 = ~My blood, though... Phaere likes its sight well enough. It would be cruel to rob the mad female of this last token.~
@1436 = ~She returned, wearing a bracelet of human workmanship, but it looked rather ancient.~
@1437 = ~Yes, I see the similarities.~
@1438 = ~I have no idea what you are talking about, Kivan! Please, we have no time for these old memories!~
@1439 = ~Centeol was more pitiful than scary.~
@1440 = ~There is something about these two women living in the company of spiders that makes me cringe.~
@1441 = ~Why did I expect you to understand?~
@1442 = ~No, I will not forget. There is this expression in your eyes, that special compassion that does not rankle. <CHARNAME>, I know that you wish me to let go of what you perceive as hatreds, but it is too late for me to change.~
@1443 = ~I wish you'd understand but even if you do not, I thank you for this glance.~
@1444 = ~It is too late for me to change.~
@1445 = ~It does.~
@1446 = ~I don't think so.~
@1447 = ~Maybe it's for the best. Your devotion to Shevarash is so complete, so pure. Letting mercy into your heart might just soil it.~
@1448 = ~Kivan, let's drop it right here before I say something I am going to regret.~
@1449 = ~Kivan, if only you could Ah, forget it.~
@1450 = ~It's useless to argue about it with you, is it? Let's go.~
@1451 = ~She was. We killed a woman, but she was a drow.~
@1452 = ~Which makes it alright for us to slaughter her without pity?~
@1453 = ~That explains the spiders. I've heard that drow are fond of them.~
@1454 = ~Hmm, it seems that irony is lost on you. Let's go, there is much yet to do.~
@1455 = ~Do you think you can ever come to feel for someone who is who is a drow for example?~
@1456 = ~Do you know that in drow a word for a 'friend' is the same as the one for a 'spider'?~
@1457 = ~Well, that explains the arachnids here!~
@1458 = ~That alone makes them into abominations! Kivan, let's drop it right here before I say something I am going to regret.~
@1459 = ~Drow do not deserve pity, even their women. Maybe I should have said especially their women. They are the ones who hold power and pull the strings of the web. Do you know that in their language a word for a 'friend' is the same as the one for a 'spider'?~
@1460 = ~Pai'na was a drow. We killed a woman, but she was a drow.~
@1461 = ~Was she? I did not notice.~
@1462 = ~So Pai'na appeared to me. Only she was a drow. We killed a woman, but she was a drow.~
@1463 = ~No, of course we don't. I just miss the forests, I suppose. Even the spider infestation was less repulsive there than in these dark crypts.~
@1464 = ~Only Pai'na was a drow. We killed a woman, but she was a drow.~
@1465 = ~This place, it reminds me of Centeol's abode in Cloakwood Forest.~
@1466 = ~Immortality why does it beckon humans so that they are ready to commit any crime for it?~
@1467 = ~You will not understand, Kivan. You are an elf, and you have spent but two years in human lands. So stop warming up the air with your breath and let's move on.~
@1468 = ~Not all humans would go to such an extent as Lavok did. Some are perfectly happy with what years were given them by the gods.~
@1469 = ~I think it is the concept rather than the possibility of eternal life that fascinates the seekers, the freedom from every restraint. Being immortal means being a god or almost.~
@1470 = ~Tell me, what would you do to save Deheriana from dying?~
@1471 = ~Then you might have guessed that the gift of long life is a double-edged blade. More often than not it weighs heavily, and brings duties and obligations beyound count. I once heard it said: 'Duty is heavier than a mountain, and death is lighter than a feather.'.~
@1472 = ~She is always here, in my heart.~
@1473 = ~Then let us walk in silence for a little while. I will think about humans.~
@1474 = ~The way you said it made me uneasy, <CHARNAME>. Blood you reminded me that the Lord of Murder's blood courses through your veins.~
@1475 = ~I think we are talking nonsense.~
@1476 = ~You are young as far as the humans are concerned, are you not?~
@1477 = ~Yes, I am young. Though sometimes I feel like I am ancient.~
@1478 = ~I am, but I have a plan for when death will start making wrinkled and graying me uneasy.~
@1479 = ~My age does not matter. Whenever death finds me, it will find me prepared to leave this Plane.~
@1480 = ~Kivan, I grow weary of this strange conversation.~
@1481 = ~A brave answer and the one I could respect. But I hope that you will stay awhile yet.~
@1482 = ~Your sire's heritage? Godhood? Be wary of speaking of it so lightly.~
@1483 = ~Yes, and I can see in his passing that his burdens were no lighter than those of an elf as well.~
@1484 = ~The gift of long life is a double-edged blade, <CHARNAME>. More often than not it weighs heavily, and brings many duties and obligations. I once heard it said: 'Duty is heavier than a mountain, and death is lighter than a feather.'~
@1485 = ~I would have given anything to save her from how she died. But if she had departed by her own will before me I would have felt no sorrow.~
@1486 = ~I am not an elf, but I think you would have grieved. It is not the passing itself that affects us, but the absence of those who we loved in our lives.~
@1487 = ~I see. Well, if you say so.~
@1488 = ~You would have given anything to forestall fate. And that's what probably fascinates the seekers, the freedom from every restraint. Being immortal means being a god or almost.~
@1489 = ~I think they are mistaken. Some gods are dead.~
@1490 = ~Yes, yes, my sire for instance. But we are talking the rule, not the exceptions.~
@1491 = ~Greater than gods, for even the gods die.~
@1492 = ~I suppose Are you one of them?~
@1493 = ~No, but I have a contingency plan.~
@1494 = ~Yes, whenever death finds me, it will find me prepared to leave this Plane.~
@1495 = ~I don't know, Kivan. Immortality is a seductive mistress for old men. The young ones' lover is death.~
@1496 = ~You are right. I do not understand. But I hoped that you might enlighten me.~
@1497 = ~You elves are so full of it! You can't even imagine what it means to see you walking around for centuries looking like adolescents, while we are given but a few short decades!~
@1498 = ~Do you know what's funny? That Lavok with all his trickery managed to buy himself a life no longer than that of an elf. Does that answer your question?~
@1499 = ~I think it is the concept rather than the possibility of eternal life that fascinates the seekers, the freedom from every restraint. Being immortal means being a god or almost. ~
@1500 = ~Even the wind feels fresher, cleaner now that Bodhi is dead and defeated.~
@1501 = ~Indeed it does, and it renews my hope.~
@1502 = ~Is something wrong with your sense of smell? It stinks of rotten fish and sewage from the Bridge District.~
@1503 = ~Don't get dizzy with success. The fight is far from over.~
@1504 = ~Of course the air feels fresh after those dead crypts. How I hated them!~
@1505 = ~How can this be a victory if my heart bleeds and I carry the corpse of the one I love?~
@1506 = ~I wish I had your optimism, Kivan. I am afraid, I am deathly afraid now that I have seen how powerful Bodhi was.~
@1507 = ~(laugh) Oh, the beautiful, beautiful wind!~
@1508 = ~No, it will not.~
@1509 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I cannot find other words, but a simple 'thank you', yet do not measure the depth of my gratitude from it.~
@1510 = ~How can you be so childish! Elhan is just a man you cannot withhold your sympathy, your help because of one man!~
@1511 = ~Yes, I fight for my kin and to punish a foul man. But above all, I intend to see you whole again, <CHARNAME>. If that is the last thing I am destined to accomplish in this life, so be it. I want to see you whole.~
@1512 = ~He is a thief, and the soul is yours. He had no right to torture and decimate you. I will not let you forget it, and neither I will let him to forget it! I intend to see you whole again, <CHARNAME>. You have my word.~
@1513 = ~If it can be done, it will be. Help is close at hand in a city like this. You will find the way to save your lover.~
@1514 = ~You are more savvy in the ways of the world than I was, <CHARNAME>, and help is close at hand in a city like this. You will find a way to save your lover..~
@1515 = ~You are not alone, <CHARNAME>, and this has to count for something. Help is close at hand in a city like this. You will find a way to save your lover.~
@1516 = ~And let it carry us to a sunnier shore!~
@1517 = ~So we shall. Lead on, my Captain.~
@1518 = ~He can be defeated. He was defeated once since he ended up as an Exile. Remember that.~
@1519 = ~Please, reconsider. Not only you are risking your own self, but behind the magical veil, the people of Suldanessellar are being slaughtered.~
@1520 = ~They weren't particularly nice to me.~
@1521 = ~You have a point. Very well, we'll make haste for the Forest of Tethir.~
@1522 = ~We shall see. Come now, whatever I decide to do, dallying here won't help Suldanessellar.~
@1523 = ~We honored the dead by destroying the vampires who defiled their resting place.~
@1524 = ~I am glad to see you in high spirits!~
@1525 = ~You are wise, <CHARNAME>. Yet take it from the man who'd thought his life over a dozen times: there are worse ways to die than fall in battle against an evil vampire. Brave were our dead, and honorable. Let us all find death as clean as theirs was.~
@1526 = ~It brought color to your cheeks. What a joy to see you like that again after you were so pale of late.~
@1527 = ~But you will be hale soon: we are going to fight for your soul. We cannot lose. We cannot!~
@1528 = ~In a matter of speaking, Irenicus will be fighting for his soul, since he took mine for his.~
@1529 = ~I thought that you were fighting for Suldanessellar, for the elves?~
@1530 = ~We can. Forgive me if I am not overly enthusiastic about a show down with the mightiest wizard we've met apart from Elminster.~
@1531 = ~Yes, it is so, and we shall also do our duty in helping Suldanessellar.~
@1532 = ~I would tell you to be strong, only I have never known anyone stronger... But we are fighting for your soul. We cannot lose. We cannot!~
@1533 = ~Yes, it is so, and we shall also do our duty of helping Suldanessellar.~
@1534 = ~Do not forsake hope, <CHARNAME>. It cannot end that way, it cannot!~
@1535 = ~You can appreciate better than anyone else that it very well can.~
@1536 = ~I am afraid to hope, but I will do what I can to bring my beloved back from the darkness.~
@1537 = ~You are right. I was wrong to despair.~
@1538 = ~Not as much as I did, I am sure.~
@1539 = ~It is difficult to remain levelheaded. We have the lantern that will light the way to saving Suldanessellar, and restoring you to your soul!~
@1540 = ~Should I dance with joy when my heart bleeds and I carry the corpse of the one I love?~
@1541 = ~Not so quickly. We must attend to the price we've paid for the triumph. To our dead.~
@1542 = ~Not so fast! We have obligations that are yet unfulfilled.~
@1543 = ~Or to our death. Forgive me if I am not overly enthusiastic about a show down with the mightiest wizard we've met apart from Elminster.~
@1544 = ~Yes, it is so, and we shall do our duty.~
@1545 = ~We are riding the tide of momentous events!~
@1546 = ~My heart overwhelms my senses. We have the lantern that will light the way to saving Suldanessellar, and restoring you to your soul.~
@1547 = ~Then praised be the wind!~
@1548 = ~Just don't get dizzy with success. The fight is far from over.~
@1549 = ~Well, we had our moment of giddy euphoria. Now, let us attend to the price we've paid for the triumph. To our dead.~
@1550 = ~To the wind of victory!~
@1551 = ~Stop shouting already. This is a cemetery, for the sake of all gods. Show the dead some respect.~
@1552 = ~Some say that happiness is not in reaching the destination, but the journey itself. Oh, fools.~
@1553 = ~Not so much fools as people who find it difficult to be content.~
@1554 = ~I take it you disagree.~
@1555 = ~Well, I'll take your word for it. You are positively radiating happiness, so you should know.~
@1556 = ~What's happiness anyway?~
@1557 = ~The strength, the vibrancy of your spirit never ceases to amaze me. Despite the insurmountable odds you did not forget how to smile. ~
@1558 = ~Then I won't query you further. I wish you to find happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@1559 = ~Perhaps.~
@1560 = ~Be wary of valuing hardness overmuch. More often than not it also means being brittle.~
@1561 = ~I wish you to find happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@1562 = ~This is sad, but understandable given what you face. Maybe, after your soul is restored to you, you will search for happiness and find it.~
@1563 = ~I can only admire your morals. You find personal fulfillment in what I see as every man's duty.~
@1564 = ~That I cannot understand, <CHARNAME>.~
@1565 = ~I am not surprised, knowing your upbringing.~
@1566 = ~When you talk about it, it sounds exciting indeed.~
@1567 = ~Yes, the sights, the smells, the sounds, the feel of the great outdoors have a healing and empowering quality.~
@1568 = ~I feel the same way, <CHARNAME>, but you must know that already.~
@1569 = ~Then you picked the right occupation. You certainly do not lack foes and battles.~
@1570 = ~Thank you. What about you? Are you happy?~
@1571 = ~I know neither what I need, nor what I want, but I always expect to find... something.~
@1572 = ~Nothing makes me happy, Kivan.~
@1573 = ~You are starting to see the world through rose glasses. Your happy ending softened you, Kivan. Mine own is far from certain. I don't even have my soul!~
@1574 = ~I truly don't know.~
@1575 = ~Yes, despite it all, I have hope, and I'm happy.~
@1576 = ~What the rest of the world called my folly. My crime, even.~
@1577 = ~Love.~
@1578 = ~<CHARNAME>, I need nothing but my Deheriana and that she loves me.~
@1579 = ~How unbearably sentimental!~
@1580 = ~I envy you a little. I know neither what I need, nor what I want, but I always expect to find... something.~
@1581 = ~I am glad that you are happy, Kivan.~
@1582 = ~Yes, you guessed right. I only need my Deheriana and that she loves me.~
@1583 = ~So, what type are you? Do you know what makes you happy?~
@1584 = ~The battlefield. I feel alive and mighty and happy.~
@1585 = ~I feel happy when I am with my lover... Love is truly the only thing that makes me happy.~
@1586 = ~I am happy when I take a stroll through the wilderness. One look at nature's marvels - and all my troubles feel insignificant.~
@1587 = ~I am happy in the middle of a grand party, surrounded by laughing and singing crowds... the excitement and glamour is wonderful!~
@1588 = ~Solitude and a good book - those always make me happy.~
@1589 = ~Power, having power over the elements and people's souls - that is what brings me happiness.~
@1590 = ~Being a harbinger of justice and defender of the weak... however pompous that might sound. I feel ecstatic when I do good and see things straightened out.~
@1591 = ~I pity them, I think. Myself, I only need my Deheriana and that she loves me.~
@1592 = ~Do you never feel happy, mellonamin? Truly?~
@1593 = ~I do on the battlefield. I feel alive and mighty and happy.~
@1594 = ~Solitude and a good book... those make me happy.~
@1595 = ~Do not tell me that you do not know. Do you never feel happy?~
@1596 = ~I am happy, <CHARNAME>. I have almost forgotten how it feels.~
@1597 = ~Let me guess. It's your Deheriana.~
@1598 = ~And what caused this delirium?~
@1599 = ~I do. I am a simple man, and I know very well what I wish for.~
@1600 = ~Well, I'm not like you. I know neither what I need, nor what I want, but I always expect to find... something.~
@1601 = ~Let me guess. All you need is your Deheriana.~
@1602 = ~And that would be?~
@1603 = ~The worrisome lot who never know what they want?~
@1604 = ~Yes, and I am one of them. I know neither what I need, nor what I want, but I always expect to find... something.~
@1605 = ~Not your type, eh?~
@1606 = ~Precisely.~
